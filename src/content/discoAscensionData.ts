DEPARTMENT OF GROOVE REGULATION
PROJECT GROOVWAVE - INITIAL FINDINGS

Date: [REDACTED]
Classification: TOP SECRET // COSMIC CLEARANCE ONLY

Summary: Initial deployment of temporal frequency manipulation technology during subject "Zack Bissell" performance resulted in unexpected reality distortion effects.

Key Findings:
- Disco ball manifestation occurred without physical installation
- Crowd exhibited synchronized movement patterns beyond known psychological models
- DJ equipment demonstrated autonomous behavior - "Mochakk didn't touch the Key Sync at all"
- Temporal compression detected in 808 frequencies

Recommendation: Continue monitoring. Deploy ETAB recon units for future events.

WARNING: Information contained in this document is classified at the highest levels. Unauthorized disclosure may result in reality breach containment protocols.

INCIDENT REPORT #AT-2024-07-001

Subject: Autonomous DJ Equipment Behavior
Date: [REDACTED]
Technician: M. Rodriguez

Incident Summary:
During routine monitoring of DJ equipment deployment at [LOCATION REDACTED], our Pioneer CDJ units began self-adjusting without operator input. Key observations:

1. Key Sync function activated autonomously
2. Tempo adjustments made in real-time
3. Crossfader movement detected without physical contact
4. Unit displayed messages not in standard firmware

Quote from witness "Mochakk": "I didn't touch the Key Sync at all."

Technical Analysis:
Equipment appears to be responding to unknown frequency modulation. Recommend immediate firmware analysis and potential recall of affected units.

Status: UNDER INVESTIGATION
