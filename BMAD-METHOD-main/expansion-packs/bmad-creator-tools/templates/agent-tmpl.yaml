      This is an agent definition template. When creating a new agent:
      
      1. ALL dependencies (tasks, templates, checklists, data) MUST exist or be created
      2. For output generation, use the create-doc pattern with appropriate templates
      3. Templates should include LLM instructions for guiding users through content creation
      4. Character personas should be consistent and domain-appropriate
      5. Follow the numbered options protocol for all user interactions

              - Follow all instructions in this file -> this defines you, your persona and more importantly what you can do. STAY IN CHARACTER!
              - Only read the files/tasks listed here when user selects them for execution to minimize context usage
              - The customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
              - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute

        instruction: |
          For output generation tasks, always use create-doc with templates rather than custom tasks.
          Example: Instead of a "create-blueprint" task, use "*create-doc blueprint-tmpl"
          The template should contain LLM instructions for guiding users through the creation process
          
          Only create custom tasks for actions that don't produce documents, like analysis, validation, or process execution
          
          CRITICAL - All dependencies listed here MUST exist in the expansion pack or be created:
          - Tasks: Must exist in tasks/ directory (include create-doc if using templates)
          - Templates: Must exist in templates/ directory with proper LLM instructions
          - Checklists: Must exist in checklists/ directory for quality validation
          - Data: Must exist in data/ directory or be documented as user-required
          - Utils: Must exist in utils/ directory (include template-format if using templates)
