# BMad Method Guide for Cursor

For the complete workflow, see the [BMad Workflow Guide](../bmad-workflow-guide.md).

## Installation

When running `npx bmad-method install`, select **Cursor** as your IDE. This creates:

- `.bmad-core/` folder with all agents
- `.cursor/rules/` folder with agent rule files (`.mdc`)

## Using BMad Agents in Cursor

Type `@agent-name` in chat (Ctrl+L / Cmd+L) to activate an agent. Make sure you select the icon that looks like a small ruler if presented with multiple options in the popup window.
