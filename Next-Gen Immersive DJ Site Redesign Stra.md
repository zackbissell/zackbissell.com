Next-Gen Immersive DJ Site Redesign Strategy  
(Zack Bissell)  
Vision Overview  
The goal is to reinvent Zack Bissell’s online presence into an immersive, story-driven DJ experience with the  
polish of a high-end app. This means fully embracing Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a  
clean, elegant aesthetic and smooth microinteractions, while layering on the creative, cinematic flair of a  
boutique film studio or after-hours event. In practice, the design will favor minimalist layouts, refined  
typography (using Apple’s SF Pro or similar for clarity), and fluid transitions that add a sense of depth  
without overwhelming the user 1 2  
. Every interactive detail should feel intentional yet unobtrusive – for  
1  
example, buttons with gentle haptic-like feedback and icons following a consistent visual language .  
These micro-interactions are pivotal: they transform an interface from merely functional to genuinely  
3  
enjoyable, while subtly expressing brand personality .  
At a high level, the new site will be narrative-centric and “world”-based. Each of Zack’s flagship DJ mixes  
becomes its own thematic micro-site or “story world,” complete with unique visuals, copy, and interactive  
elements that reflect the mix’s mood. The core vision is a site that feels expensive, cinematic, and polished –  
imagine Apple-level attention to detail meets A24’s artistic edge meets the vibe of a well-produced Brooklyn  
afterparty. The homepage and global design will establish this luxe, high-impact baseline (think generous  
white space, dramatic typography, and subtle motion), while each mix’s section will deviate into its own  
immersive aesthetic. Crucially, all of this must be achieved with a mobile-first approach: the experience  
should be just as compelling on a phone as on a widescreen, leveraging responsive design to adapt layouts  
fluidly to different breakpoints 4  
. Accessibility is non-negotiable: high contrast text, proper alt  
descriptions, and consideration for screen readers will be baked in from the start (Apple’s guidelines call for  
at least a 4.5:1 text contrast for readability 5  
). In summary, the vision marries Apple-grade UX (clarity,  
efficiency, inclusivity) 6  
with immersive storytelling (bespoke visuals, audio-reactive surprises) to create  
a DJ site that is both a polished product and a digital adventure.  
User Journey / Navigation Map  
We will craft an intuitive yet exploratory user journey that guides visitors through Zack’s content as a  
narrative adventure. Below is a high-level flow of how a user might experience the new site:  
1\.  
Landing on Home: A visitor arrives at the homepage and is greeted with a cinematic hero section.  
For example, a bold tagline (“It all begins with a story”) fades in with a subtle animation, immediately  
communicating the narrative theme. This page establishes the site’s high-end feel – think a clean  
Apple-like interface with a hint of motion to draw the eye (e.g. a gentle parallax or fade-in on the  
tagline). The navigation menu is minimal and fixed at top, perhaps showing just a logo and a menu  
icon or simple links (Home, Mixes/Worlds, About, Contact) in an elegant font. The user quickly  
perceives that this is not a typical DJ homepage but a portal into different stories.  
12\.  
3\.  
4\.  
5\.  
Scanning Featured Mix “Worlds”: Scrolling down the home page reveals a featured mixes section  
showcasing the flagship DJ mixes as entry points to their “worlds.” Each mix is represented by a  
preview card with thematic imagery and a teaser description. For instance, the “Disco Ascension”  
card might show a surreal, retro-futuristic graphic with a “CLASSIFIED” warning badge motif  
(echoing its conspiracy theme) and a subheading like “A Disco House Paradox.” Similarly, “Nostalgia  
Trap” might be previewed with a moody, intimate image and a tag like “For the Emotionally  
Unstable.” These cards likely use a hover or tap microinteraction – e.g. hovering could slightly  
animate the card (scale up or a shimmer effect) to indicate interactivity. The user can swipe (on  
mobile) or scroll through these feature cards, which are presented in a mobile-friendly carousel or  
stacked layout. This section essentially acts as a narrative menu, inviting the user to choose their  
journey.  
Entering a Mix World: When the user clicks or taps on a specific mix (e.g. Nostalgia Trap), instead of  
a jarring page load, a thematic transition animation plays (leveraging Framer Motion). For  
example, for Nostalgia Trap, the screen might briefly fade to black with a pulsing heart icon before  
revealing the new page – reinforcing the emotional theme. This is a “rift-jump” interaction that  
makes entering each world feel deliberate and exciting. Under the hood, we’ll use Framer Motion’s  
\<AnimatePresence\> and route transition hooks to animate page exits and entrances smoothly  
(e.g. fading out the home content and fading in the world content with a slight delay for effect). The  
goal is to make the user feel like they’ve stepped into a new environment while keeping navigation  
feel seamless.  
Exploring the World (Multi-Page Narrative): Inside a mix’s world, navigation may deepen. The user  
is typically landed on the World’s intro page – for example, Disco Ascension’s intro presents a  
briefing-style warning (“CLASSIFIED MATERIAL”) and the mix title in dramatic fashion. The user can  
scroll to read narrative content that sets the scene (e.g. storyline paragraphs, imagery, quotes). In  
some cases, an introductory overlay might appear: Nostalgia Trap, for instance, could first display a  
full-screen prompt “Before You Enter...” asking the user to recall an emotional memory, then a button  
“I’m Ready to Remember” which, when clicked, reveals the page content. Such an overlay acts as an  
immersive prompt to prime the listener’s mindset. Once in the world, the user can navigate to sub-  
sections/pages of that world: for example, a sticky sub-nav or simply scrolling could reveal sections  
like “Story”, “Tracklist”, “Gallery” or “Blog”. Each of these could be separate pages or anchored  
sections with unique content but consistent thematic styling. The navigation within a world will use  
thematic icons and labels (e.g., a small UFO icon for Disco Ascension’s conspiracy blog, a broken heart  
icon for Nostalgia Trap’s personal anecdotes section, etc.), reinforcing that each world has its own  
identity.  
Media Playback and Interaction: A core part of each world is listening to the DJ mix itself. The user  
will encounter a built-in audio player (likely an embedded SoundCloud or Mixcloud player) on the  
intro page or a dedicated “Listen” page. This embedded player will allow playback without leaving  
the site – e.g. a SoundCloud widget showing the waveform and play controls inline 7  
. The design  
ensures this embed feels native: perhaps skinned with a custom color scheme matching the world,  
or framed by narrative context (“Recovered from the Groove Singularity incident” might caption the  
Disco Ascension player, per its lore). The user can play the mix and continue reading content; if they  
navigate to other pages of the world, the audio could persist (either by using a global player  
component or by relying on SoundCloud’s persistent play if the embed is not unloaded). Additionally,  
interactive visuals might respond to the music: for later phases, we plan that as music plays,  
2certain elements on the page animate in sync (e.g. an SVG equalizer bar or background glow that  
pulses to the beat). Initially, this might be subtle (like a faint equalizer icon pulsing) to avoid  
distracting the user, but it adds a layer of immersion – the site feels alive to the sound.  
6\.  
Deeper Story and Calls to Action: As the user explores, they might click through to auxiliary  
content. For instance, Disco Ascension could have a “Conspiracy Blog” page where a hidden story or  
fake forum posts deepen the Montauk conspiracy narrative. Nostalgia Trap might have an “Emotional  
Debrief” page where Zack writes a personal note about the inspiration behind the mix. These are  
optional deep dives for fans who want more than just music – they turn each mix into a mini story  
universe. Meanwhile, global CTAs are subtly available: a persistent “Newsletter Signup” prompt  
might slide up at the bottom or appear after a certain scroll, inviting the user to subscribe for  
updates on new mixes or events. A “Book Zack” or contact button could be present in the footer or as  
a floating action, allowing industry folks to quickly reach the booking form when needed. The  
journey ensures no dead ends – from any point, the user can navigate to another world (via a global  
nav menu or a “Explore other worlds” carousel at page bottom), go to the About section to learn  
about Zack, or use the contact links.  
7\.  
Exiting or Switching Worlds: If the user decides to jump to a different mix world or back to Home, a  
consistent navigation is key. A top-left back arrow or a menu can bring them back to the main hub.  
Alternatively, a creative approach: maybe an “Eject” button styled to the world (e.g. in Disco  
Ascension it could be a small “EXIT PROTOCOL” button) that returns to the main menu. Switching  
directly between worlds could be allowed via a menu listing all mixes, or possibly a fun transition  
(e.g. a “Next Story” button at the end of one world leading into the next chronologically or  
thematically). All these transitions again use smooth Framer Motion animations to maintain  
continuity. The user should feel in control and never lost – breadcrumbs or clear page titles will  
indicate where they are (“Nostalgia Trap – Tracklist” clearly labeled, for example).  
8\.  
Supporting Pages Journey: In addition to the mix worlds, the journey includes standard pages:  
About (where the user can read Zack’s bio, perhaps styled in the site’s core aesthetic), Press/  
Testimonials (social proof and media quotes, possibly a simple elegant list of pull quotes), Watch (if  
hosting video content like live performance clips – to be integrated in future), Lab Obsidian  
(potentially a blog or project space for deep-dives or essays; user can browse posts if this exists), and  
Contact/Booking (where the user fills a form for booking inquiries). The navigation map accounts  
for these: the header or footer will have links to these sections. For instance, a user reading about  
Zack can easily jump to listening to a mix via an inline link “Hear the latest mix here” or navigate via  
the menu. Mobile navigation will likely collapse into a hamburger menu with a sleek full-screen  
menu overlay listing all worlds and pages in a visually pleasing way (perhaps with icons or subtle  
animations for each link).  
Throughout this journey, performance and responsiveness ensure the user isn’t kept waiting. Content  
loads asynchronously; images might be lazy-loaded as needed. The user should feel that moving through  
the site is quick and smooth, much like a native app. Combined with touch-friendly design (large tap targets  
per Apple HIG and swipe gestures where appropriate) 8  
, this journey is designed to be as frictionless as  
possible while still delighting the user at each turn with narrative and interactive surprises.  
3Page \+ Story World Architecture  
The site’s architecture can be thought of as two layers: global pages (the overarching site sections) and  
“story world” sub-sites for each flagship mix. Below is a structured breakdown of the planned pages and  
the content/role of each:  
•  
Home (Landing Page): Purpose: Act as a portal and introduction. It will feature a hero section with a  
strong brand narrative (“Not just a DJ, but a sonic architect of unforgettable experiences” could  
rotate in a quote carousel 9  
), followed by the Featured Mixes grid or slider showcasing the  
flagship worlds. Each featured mix preview includes title, subtitle, a one-liner description, and a  
cover image evocative of that world. (These are drawn from a data structure so they can be updated  
– e.g. the site’s code uses an array of featuredMixes with title, subtitle, description, image, etc.  
10  
11  
). The home page might also highlight upcoming events or latest news in a brief section, but  
primarily it’s the narrative menu. Visual style: white or neutral background (to let the colorful world  
thumbnails pop), sleek typography, and maybe an “immersive” scroll effect (like quotes fading in  
and out, as seen with the rotating quotes on the current home prototype 9  
).  
•  
About: Purpose: Present Zack’s story, credentials, and personality. This page will likely be a single-  
page profile with a high-quality photo or video loop of Zack performing, and text about his  
background (e.g. his journey from Broadway stages to Brooklyn rooftops, technical precision \+  
emotional chaos philosophy 12  
). The design here aligns with the core site aesthetic (think of an  
Apple artist profile: clean layout, balanced text, maybe some iconography for fun facts or stats). If  
Zack has notable press quotes or achievements, they can be called out here as well (though there is  
also a separate Press page). The About page should also reiterate the “sonic architect” narrative  
and link to key content (like “Check out the latest world: Disco Ascension” to drive traffic into the  
immersive sections).  
•  
Mix World: Disco Ascension – World Overview: This is a multi-page section dedicated to the Disco  
Ascension mix, which has a cinematic, surreal, conspiracy-laced aesthetic. The pages in this world  
include:  
•  
•  
Disco Ascension – Intro/Story Page: The main page that users land on. It sets the stage with  
elements like a top-secret briefing vibe. For instance, a banner at top labeled “CLASSIFIED MATERIAL”  
with an alert icon immediately conveys the playful conspiracy theme 13  
. The title “DISCO  
ASCENSION” appears in an eye-catching style (large, perhaps with a retro-futuristic gradient or glitch  
effect reminiscent of Y2K web design, as currently implemented with an amber-to-red gradient text  
14 15  
). A subtitle “A Disco House Paradox” explains the genre/story angle . Below that, narrative  
text warns the user humorously about the mix’s effects (time dilation, urges to investigate cover-ups  
– tying into the Montauk story) 16  
. This page also houses the audio player for the mix: likely an  
embedded Mixcloud or SoundCloud widget with custom styling. In the prototype, there’s a  
placeholder showing a radio icon and “Mixcloud Player Integration” note 17  
. We will replace that  
with a real SoundCloud embed that’s responsive. The player will be contained in a styled card with  
18  
the mix’s “last known copy” context .  
Disco Ascension – “Conspiracy Blog” Page: This sub-page (or section) dives deeper into the  
narrative. It might be presented as a fake blog or archive of “evidence” tying into the mix’s story. For  
example, it could list a series of mysterious log entries or “research notes” about disco frequencies  
causing time anomalies in Montauk. In the current design, this content was toggled via a button  
4•  
(“Show Conspiracy”) revealing a hidden section 19  
– but we plan to break it into its own page for  
better deep-linking. The aesthetic here could mimic an early internet forum or document: think Y2K  
web design cues like monospace text, retro pixel graphics, perhaps intentionally low-fi diagrams, all  
within the cinematic styling (maybe shown on a “terminal” style card that overlays the page). This  
playful homage to conspiracy sites ties directly to Disco Ascension’s world, much like how A24  
created an interactive retro desktop site to promote its Y2K film 20  
. We’ll ensure consistency: the  
user can toggle or navigate to this blog page and back easily (with an obvious close or back UI).  
Disco Ascension – Tracklist & Credits: A page listing the tracklist of the mix (artist and track names  
with timestamps, possibly) and any narrative commentary on each track if relevant to the story. This  
could also list credits (like if there are collaborators, or credit to the original story inspiration). The  
tracklist might be displayed in a styled table or list with icons (maybe a small vinyl icon or document  
icon per track to keep the theme). If desired, this page can double as a Download/Share page:  
providing a link to the mix on SoundCloud/Mixcloud, share buttons, etc., in case users want to share  
Disco Ascension specifically.  
Visual Identity: Disco Ascension’s world uses cinematic surrealism \+ Y2K conspiracy aesthetic. Expect a  
dark background (black or deep-space gradient) with neon or laser-like accent colors (amber, red as already  
used 21  
). Micro-details like a flickering CRT effect on some text, “redacted” style overlays on images, or  
glitch hover effects can reinforce the theme. However, all interactions and text must remain accessible – e.g.  
ensure contrast for all critical text (warnings in high-contrast red/white) and provide alternate text for any  
image-based text.  
•  
•  
•  
Mix World: Nostalgia Trap – World Overview: A multi-page section for the Nostalgia Trap mix,  
focused on chaotic emotionality and intimacy. Pages include:  
Nostalgia Trap – Intro/Story Page: This page introduces the mix with an emotional hazard theme.  
At the top, instead of “Classified”, it might have a pill-shaped label like “EMOTIONAL HAZARD” in a  
purple tone with a warning icon 22  
. The title “NOSTALGIA TRAP” appears in a stylized gradient  
spanning purple, pink, amber – conveying a mix of warmth and pain 23  
. A subtitle like “A DJ Mix for  
the Emotionally Unstable” directly sets the mood with a bit of dark humor 24  
. The content here is  
narrative and personal: a series of paragraphs speak directly to the listener about that person from  
the past and the flood of memories 25  
. The language is intimate and a bit cheeky (“Listen or don’t,  
I’m not your life coach.” is a quip in the text 26  
). This draws the user into a reflective emotional  
space. Before they even get to the audio, we present the interactive prompt overlay: an initial  
modal that asks the user to “Think of someone who left you wrecked…Now press play and let  
nostalgia trap you” 27  
. The user clicks “I’m Ready to Remember” to close the overlay and reveal the  
page 28  
– this adds a theatrical touch to the experience, like a guided meditation into memory. The  
audio player on this page will again be an embedded SoundCloud (or Mixcloud) player, perhaps  
introduced with a small note like “Press Play and Relive” and accompanied by a symbolic graphic (a  
broken heart, etc.). Additionally, Nostalgia Trap’s intro might contain a tracklist preview or a  
narrative breakdown: currently the code holds a tracklist array 29  
– we will display it either on the  
intro or on a dedicated tracklist page.  
Nostalgia Trap – Tracklist & Story Page: This page (or section) can combine the detailed tracklist  
with more storytelling. Each track could have an annotation about why it’s included (“this one  
reminds me of X moment…” etc.), giving an A24-like emotional soundtrack vibe. The tracklist can be  
interactive: perhaps clicking a track could skip the SoundCloud player to that timestamp (if we can  
control the embed via SDK or at least provide timestamps). This would encourage users to engage  
deeper with the music in context of the story.  
5•  
Nostalgia Trap – “Aftermath” Blog/Page: Potentially, a page for post-mix reflection or community  
engagement. For example, it might invite users to submit their own nostalgic story (this could just be  
conceptual for now, or a simple comment section). Or it could be a faux “diary entry” from Zack  
reflecting on performing that mix live and the emotions in the room. This page would be relatively  
simple (text-focused) but keeps users in the emotional loop a bit longer, increasing engagement.  
Visual Identity: Nostalgia Trap’s design is chaotic yet intimate. Background could be very dark (black) with  
smoky purple/pink gradients bleeding into it (to feel moody and dreamlike). Typography might lean a bit  
more stylized here (perhaps a cursive or italics for certain quotes to evoke a personal diary). We’ll use some  
glitch or blur effects to represent emotional chaos – e.g. images or text that subtly warp or blur at  
random, like tears in vision or erratic TikTok jump cuts. However, the layout should still be structured  
elegantly (like an A24 film site): lots of space, each paragraph thoughtfully placed, nothing truly random  
that would confuse navigation. The microinteractions in this world might include a heart icon that pulses (as  
already prototyped 30  
) or a background element that gently oscillates in hue, representing mood swings.  
Importantly, all these will be implemented with GPU-optimized animations via Framer Motion or CSS, to  
keep performance smooth. We also keep accessibility in mind: any flashing or glitch effects must be subtle  
enough to avoid triggering sensitivities (and we can provide a “reduce motion” mode that disables the more  
chaotic animations if prefers-reduced-motion is detected).  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Mix World: House Work – Elevation – World Overview: This section will be dedicated to House Work:  
Elevation, a mix/story that implies rising energy and possibly a challenge to norms (as hinted by  
internal story drafts). Although currently marked “Coming Soon” in the routes 31  
, we have a concept  
to guide its eventual design: Elevation should feel empowering and rebellious at once – “rise above”  
is the tagline. Pages we anticipate:  
House Work: Elevation – Intro Page: Setting a scene where each beat is a step higher. Perhaps it  
uses imagery of stairs or an elevator through the clouds, juxtaposed with gritty warehouse elements  
to show the clash of house music roots vs. new heights. The title might be stylized in an upward-  
sweeping manner, and we could include a brief manifesto like text (“Join me as we elevate the  
house… Every drop takes you further” 32  
). Since the narrative seems to involve challenging purist  
views, we might have on-screen bold text like “No Purists Allowed” or something tongue-in-cheek.  
The audio player here will deliver the mix which presumably is high-energy; we might incorporate an  
audio-reactive visual, such as a vertical spectrum analyzer that literally “elevates” with the beat, or  
an SVG mountain that grows with the music, reinforcing the elevation theme.  
House Work: Elevation – Story/Acts Pages: According to the story outline, this mix might have acts  
or a film-like structure. We could break the narrative into multiple pages or sections (Act 1, Act 2, Act  
3), each with a different focus. For example: Act 1 could introduce the classic house vibe, Act 2 might  
be the disruptive middle (“Work It” track insertion described in the story draft suggests a  
confrontational moment), Act 3 might resolve by reaching a new level. Each act page can have its  
own color scheme or visual twist but unified by the overall theme. For instance, Act 2’s page could  
deliberately jolt the user with a stark design change (like a bold red background or a sudden change  
in typography) to mirror the “abrasive, confrontational” feel 33  
, then Act 3 returns to something  
more harmonious.  
House Work: Elevation – Cultural Notes/Essay: This mix’s story bible suggests a lot of commentary  
on genre and culture 34 35  
. We might dedicate a page to a written essay or director’s commentary  
from Zack – almost like liner notes that discuss the cultural implications of the mix, referencing  
specific tracks (e.g. why including Marie Davidson’s “Work It” was a statement 36 37  
). This page  
would appeal to the more intellectual fan, and could be styled like an editorial piece (perhaps using a  
magazine-style two-column layout on desktop, and a clean single column on mobile).  
6Visual Identity: House Work: Elevation should feel uplifting yet edgy. We’ll combine imagery of ascent  
(skyscrapers, ladders, geometric shapes pointing upward) with a gritty club aesthetic (neon lights, concrete  
textures). The color palette might involve deep blues and blacks with flashes of bright neon (blue-to-amber  
gradient is noted in the home teaser 32  
, which could indicate a transition from cool to warm, dark to light).  
Interactive elements might include a background “matrix” of equalizer bars that subtly rise and fall.  
Typography can be bold and modern (perhaps a condensed sans-serif for titles to indicate strength).  
Microinteractions can underscore the theme: maybe a hover on the “Elevation” text causes an arrow icon to  
animate upward. All the while, maintain HIG ideals of clear hierarchy and legibility – no matter how  
experimental the visuals get in Act 2, users should always be able to read the content and navigate (for  
example, if we use a stark color inversion as a shock, ensure text contrast remains within accessibility  
5  
bounds ).  
•  
Mix World: Role Model – World Overview: (Even if not explicitly asked, it’s worth noting as it’s in the  
featured mixes). Role Model is described as “Unhinged Excellence” with chaos, implying a high-  
energy, unpredictable world. It might have pages like an intro that emphasizes the spontaneity  
(“300 barely-heard tracks, no plan, pure instinct...” 38  
), possibly a gallery of the massive track list or  
a playful “chaos meter” that visualizes how off-the-cuff the mix was. The design here could embrace  
glitch and maximalism (collages of album art, rapid animations) but presented in an organized  
fashion (perhaps a grid that the user can expand/collapse to see the insane track count). Role  
Model’s world would likely be implemented after the first two, but its architecture fits the same  
template (Intro page with player, possibly subpage for the full tracklist or story of that wild night).  
•  
Global Pages (Press, etc.): Outside of the story worlds, the site has a few standard sections:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Press & Testimonials: A page listing notable press quotes, testimonials from clients or audiences,  
and links to any media articles or interviews. The design for this page should stay on-brand but can  
be simpler (likely a grid or list of quotes with attributions). It’s mostly text content (maybe logos of  
publications for quick visual impact). This page is secondary in the “deep immersion” sense, but  
important for Zack’s professional image. Ensure it is easy to find from navigation (likely under  
“About” or a dedicated menu item).  
Watch (Media): A placeholder for now – in the future this will host embedded videos of live sets or  
creative content (perhaps aftermovies, concept videos). The architecture anticipates a gallery or list  
of videos with titles. Using a service like YouTube/Vimeo embed will be straightforward. We should  
design it such that it can expand (for example, eventually becoming a video archive page).  
Lab Obsidian: Possibly Zack’s blog or project journal. The site map reserves a route for this, implying  
down the line he might post articles or mix concept essays. We’ll treat it like a blog section: a main  
page listing posts (each post likely corresponding to a mix concept or a behind-the-scenes topic),  
and individual post pages. For launch, this can remain hidden or “coming soon,” but the framework  
will support easily adding it.  
Booking/Contact: A crucial functional page. This will contain a contact form for booking inquiries  
or general contact. Fields likely include Name, Email, Organization (if applicable), Date/Details of  
event, and a message. We’ll integrate a form handler (could be an email service or a service like  
Formspree or a simple serverless function) to collect submissions. The page should also list any  
direct contact info (like an agent’s email, if Zack uses one) and possibly an FAQ about bookings.  
Design-wise, follow Apple’s form design cues: clear labels, large tap-friendly fields, appropriate input  
types on mobile (email keyboard, etc.), and obvious submission feedback. We will use  
microinteractions here too – e.g. when the user successfully submits, they might see a nice  
7checkmark animation or toast message confirming receipt. Accessibility is important: labels  
associated with inputs, error states announced if a field is invalid, etc.  
•  
Persistent Elements:  
•  
•  
Global Navigation Bar: Present on all pages (though we might hide it or use a minimal version on  
the immersive mix pages to reduce distraction). This nav will contain the main links (or an icon to  
open a menu with those links). On desktop, likely a simple top bar with the Zack Bissell logo on left  
and menu items on right. On mobile, likely a hamburger icon that opens a full-screen menu. We will  
ensure the nav is easily usable: large click targets, logical grouping (maybe “Worlds” menu vs “Info”  
menu). It should also be consistent in placement (preferably fixed top). Framer Motion can be used  
to add subtle reveal/hide behavior – e.g. nav auto-hides when scrolling down and reappears when  
scrolling up, much like native apps. The nav styling will align with the expensive/cinematic feel  
(possibly translucent background blur – leveraging that “Liquid Glass” effect Apple just introduced  
39  
, to let nav float above content elegantly).  
Footer: Present site-wide at the bottom. Contains secondary navigation (repeat of important links),  
social media links, and the Newsletter sign-up field. The footer should be simple and clean, maybe  
dark background with light text (in the code there is a Footer component we can build on 40  
). Also,  
including a copyright and perhaps a fun site credit (e.g. “Designed in New York – Built with Framer \+  
Codex” to subtly showcase the tech flair).  
This architecture ensures that each flagship mix can expand into a rich, multi-faceted experience while still  
being tied together under one site umbrella. Each world is essentially a silo of content with its own pages,  
but the user can smoothly navigate between them and back to the main site. Structurally, we’ll implement  
this with a React Router or Next.js nested routes approach (we see a route structure in code mapping /  
disco-ascension , /nostalgia-trap , etc. to components 41  
). If using Next.js, we’d create folder  
routes for each world (e.g. pages/disco-ascension/index.jsx, pages/disco-ascension/  
blog.jsx , etc.). If continuing with React Router (as currently), we ensure sub-route handling for each  
world if needed, or manage multiple sections within one component with internal state/anchors.  
Critically, the architecture is scalable: new mixes (like “Brooklyn 4:45” or “Voyage” as teased in the router  
42  
) can be added by creating new world sections following the same template. The design system (colors,  
typography scale, UI components) will accommodate new themes easily by adjusting a few tokens (e.g. each  
world could have a theme object defining its primary color, iconography set, background style, etc.).  
In summary, the site map is as follows: \- Home  
\- About  
\- Worlds (each with sub-pages):  
\- Disco Ascension (Story, Blog, Tracklist)  
\- Nostalgia Trap (Story, Tracklist, etc.)  
\- Role Model (Story, Tracklist)  
\- House Work: Elevation (Story, Acts/Chapters, Essay)

This comprehensive architecture covers both the immersive content and the pragmatic info pages,  
ensuring users can both dive deep into each mix’s narrative and accomplish basic tasks like contacting or  
learning about Zack. The multi-page worlds approach means deep navigation for those who want it, but  
casual visitors can still just hit play on a mix and enjoy, without being forced through every narrative  
element.  
Feature Breakdown (By Priority)  
To execute this vision, we will roll out features in order of priority, ensuring core functionality and design are  
in place first, then layering advanced enhancements. Below is a breakdown of key features grouped by  
priority (must-have for launch vs. iterative improvements):  
Phase 1 – Core Foundation (High Priority Must-Haves):  
•  
Responsive, Mobile-First Layout: Ensure the entire site uses responsive design techniques (CSS  
flex/grid layouts, fluid typography, breakpoints for tablet/desktop) so that it looks and works great  
on small screens up to large desktops. Mobile-first means starting layouts stacked and then  
enhancing on larger screens. Test on common device sizes. This is critical for user experience since a  
large portion of visitors will be on mobile.  
•  
Apple HIG-Inspired UI Design: Implement the core styling and components to meet high design  
standards. This includes using a minimalistic color palette (mostly neutrals like white/black and  
one accent color per world) to allow content to shine 1  
, using plenty of whitespace and clear visual  
hierarchy. Buttons, toggles, and other controls should follow HIG-like guidelines: e.g. large touch  
targets (44px high minimum) 8  
, obvious states (default vs hover vs active with subtle shadows or  
opacity changes), and consistent corner radii (likely moderately rounded, to mimic iOS design).  
Typography should be set with system fonts or similarly clean fonts; we should incorporate dynamic  
sizing if possible (to respect user’s text size preferences, in line with Apple’s dynamic type approach  
43 44  
). We will also include dark mode support from the start (given much of the content is dark-  
themed, the site might effectively be mostly dark; but if any light mode sections exist, ensure a  
complementary dark theme and let user or system preference toggle it).  
•  
Primary Navigation & Information Architecture: Build the top navigation bar and overall routing  
structure. Users must be able to reach all main sections easily. The nav design must be intuitive  
(expected placement, clear labels). We also ensure the URL structure is clean (human-readable links  
like /disco-ascension for that world, not IDs or query params). Setting up these routes and  
testing that back/forward browser controls work normally is a priority. The nav will include any  
needed menus for sub-pages (for example, within a world if multiple pages, have a secondary nav or  
dropdown). This also includes a 404 Not Found page styled consistently (the code has a NotFound  
45 46  
component ready ).  
•  
Hero Sections & World Entry Pages: For each flagship mix, create the introductory content page as  
described. The layout and elements for these pages are a priority since they carry the main

storytelling. We need to code the dynamic pieces like the warning badge components (e.g. the  
classified banner with icons, which can be a reusable Badge component), the big gradient title text  
(ensuring it’s accessible and not just an image), and the narrative text blocks with proper styling  
(some likely to be italic or quotes). Essentially, implement the designs for Disco Ascension and  
Nostalgia Trap intro pages first as templates, then extend to others. Ensuring the CSS for these is  
modular (possibly using Tailwind utility classes and a few custom classes for special effects) is  
important to maintain consistency.  
Embedded Audio Player Integration: Seamless music playback is critical. We will embed  
SoundCloud players for each mix (assuming the mixes are uploaded there) since SoundCloud  
provides an iframe embed that’s widely supported. The priority is to make this frictionless: the user  
should be able to play without leaving to SoundCloud’s site. The SoundCloud Visual player or  
minimal player can be used, depending on aesthetic (the visual one shows cover art and waveform  
47  
). We will customize the appearance via SoundCloud’s options if possible (or at least overlay our  
styles like a border or drop-shadow to integrate it visually). For Phase 1, a basic embed with play/  
pause is sufficient. (We will also consider offering an Apple Music or Spotify embed if available, but  
SoundCloud is the focus as it doesn’t force logins for playback and is common for DJ mixes). Each  
embed will be tested on mobile to ensure it’s responsive and controls are tappable. Additionally, to  
reduce friction, if possible we’ll preload or lazy-load the widget such that it’s ready when the user  
scrolls to it (improve perceived performance).  
Content for Each Mix (Narrative & Tracklists): Populate the site with the actual content (text copy,  
track listings, images) that has been prepared. Ensuring quality of content is a feature: e.g. all text  
should be proofread, compelling, and appropriately formatted (using headings, emphasis, lists  
where it improves clarity). The tracklist sections must be clearly formatted—perhaps an interactive  
list where each entry shows timestamp, artist, title. This is especially important for enthusiasts who  
want to see what’s in the mix. It’s a priority to have this content ready and displayed because it’s part  
of the storytelling and SEO (text content for search engines to index around these mixes).  
Microinteractions & Feedback Cues (Core Set): Implement a baseline of microinteractions to make  
the UI feel polished. For Phase 1, focus on small, useful feedback interactions: e.g. buttons that  
slightly animate on hover/press (scale up 1.05 on hover to signal interactivity), links that maybe  
underline or highlight on hover, and form elements with clearly visible focus states. Another crucial  
microinteraction is loading feedback: if clicking between pages or performing an action that takes  
time, provide a spinner or progress bar (maybe a small top-of-page progress indicator during page  
transitions). These touches ensure the user always gets feedback (a key principle: provide immediate  
feedback so the user knows their action was registered 3  
). The design of microinteractions will be  
subtle and on-brand – e.g. using the accent color of the current world for hover highlights.  
Additionally, implement scroll-based microinteractions on the home page (like the rotating quotes  
which is already in code cycling every 4s 48  
). These should be smooth and not janky.  
Accessibility Compliance (Baseline): From the start, ensure that all pages meet basic accessibility  
standards. This includes proper semantic HTML structure (headings in order, landmarks like nav/  
main/footer), ALT text on images (describing any visual content, especially those used in narrative),  
and sufficient color contrast for text on all backgrounds 5  
. We also ensure the site can be  
navigated via keyboard (e.g. the focus order should follow visual order, skip links if needed to jump  
to content). All interactive elements should have ARIA labels or screenreader-friendly text if their  
10purpose isn’t clear from text alone (for instance, an icon-only button like a play icon must have  
aria-label="Play" ). We should test using a screen reader for key flows (play a mix, fill contact  
form) to catch any issues early. Another aspect: if we include animations, we respect user  
preferences – e.g. use prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable or simplify animations  
for users who opt out of motion. Phase 1 aims to avoid any accessibility blockers.  
•  
SEO and Performance Basics: Implement technical SEO best practices: unique and descriptive page  
titles for each page (e.g. “Disco Ascension – Zack Bissell” for that world’s main page), meta  
descriptions summarizing content, proper use of meta tags for social sharing (Open Graph tags so  
that when someone shares a link, it shows a nice preview image and description). Also, ensure the  
site is indexable (no rogue noindex ). Performance-wise, optimize images (compress them, use  
modern formats if possible, and use \<img srcset\> for responsive loading). Also, code-split the  
JavaScript by route (if using Next or dynamic import in React Router) so that each world’s heavy  
content (like large images or long scripts) doesn’t all load on the first paint of the homepage. Use  
lazy loading for iframes (so SoundCloud embed loads when needed). These steps will help initial load  
times and SEO which is crucial for discovery.  
•  
Newsletter Signup Module: Implement a newsletter opt-in form, likely in the footer or as a slide-in  
prompt. For Phase 1, this could be as simple as collecting an email address with a brief call-to-action  
(“Join the mailing list for new mixes & events”). The form should integrate with a service Zack uses  
(Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.) via an embed form or API – or at least send an email notification to Zack  
for manual handling until an automated integration is set. The design should be compact and not  
annoying; perhaps an input field and submit button right in the footer bar, or a one-click “Subscribe”  
button that pops up a field. Ensuring double opt-in and GDPR compliance if needed (e.g. include a  
note about privacy) is a consideration. Since this is user data collection, it must be fully functional at  
launch.  
•  
Contact/Booking Form: Develop the booking inquiry form on the contact page. This is a must-have  
to replace whatever contact mechanism the Squarespace site had. The form should validate input  
(e.g. email field contains an email, required fields filled) and upon submission either send an email to  
Zack’s contact address or store it in a database. Initially, an email send via a service (EmailJS,  
formspree, or a custom cloud function) is straightforward. Also display a confirmation message so  
the user knows it went through (“Thanks for reaching out, I’ll get back to you soon.”). Because  
booking requests are important, this form needs to be reliable – so test it thoroughly (network  
request succeeding, error handling if the email service fails, etc.). Also, spam protection measures  
like a simple honeypot field or reCAPTCHA should be considered to avoid spam submissions.  
Phase 2 – Enhanced Interactivity & Visual Immersion (Secondary Priority / Iterative Upgrades):  
•  
Advanced Framer Motion Transitions: After the core is stable, we will enhance the site with more  
elaborate animations using Framer Motion. This includes page transition animations when  
navigating between worlds and pages (e.g. a custom transition per world as described in the user  
journey). We’ll configure AnimatePresence to handle exit animations so that when the user clicks a
