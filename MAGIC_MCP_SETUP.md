       "command": "npx",
       "args": [
         "-y",
         "@21st-dev/magic@latest",
         "API_KEY=\"860d30c7c122af901b14de8ff6ebe5535fe714f92d69102a40e4bf258cf44686\""
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code**
   - Close and reopen Claude Code
   - The Magic MCP server should now be available

### Option 2: Configuration File Method
