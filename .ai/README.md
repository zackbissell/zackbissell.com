# AI Workflow Directory

This directory contains files used by the BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) system for managing the ZackBissell.com immersive storytelling platform development.

## Files

- `debug-log.md` - Tracks development issues and debugging sessions
- `core-dump{n}.md` - Chat conversation exports for preservation and analysis

## Usage

These files are automatically managed by BMAD agents during development workflow. The debug log helps track recurring issues and solutions, while core dumps preserve important conversation contexts for future reference.
