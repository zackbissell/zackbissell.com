YouTube: The audit of Zack’s YouTube content reveals a lot of untapped potential and a need for  
strategic direction. His current uploads – the House Work: Elevation film, some live set recordings,  
maybe a promo or two – are great conceptually (they align with his immersive storytelling brand).  
However, they aren’t reaching many people, likely due to lack of consistency, lack of promotion, and  
YouTube’s algorithm not having enough data to favor his channel yet. In 2025, YouTube can be  
leveraged in a few ways by a DJ like Zack:  
Long-form content for die-hards: e.g., full DJ sets or themed mixes with cool visuals. (The risk here  
is copyright, but some DJs post mixes with either minor edits or accept demonetization; if Zack isn’t  
monetizing yet, the main concern is just takedowns. Alternatively, he can split mixes into parts or  
talk over them to classify as “commentary”). Since Zack already made a 37-minute “Disco Ascension  
Live” video 28  
and a full film, he has the capability.  
Shorts for discovery: YouTube Shorts (under 60s vertical videos) might actually be a duplicate effort  
of TikTok, but posting those same viral TikToks as Shorts could net him additional exposure. Shorts  
can lead users to his channel and possibly convert to subscribers who will check out his longer  
videos.  
Educational or behind-the-scenes: Many artists grow on YouTube by sharing knowledge or  
personality. Zack could do a series like “Storytime with a DJ” where in 5 minutes he recounts a wild  
club night (no music needed, just engaging storytelling – fitting for his persona). Or a tutorial of how  
he prepares an immersive set. These might attract aspiring DJs or the musically curious, expanding  
his reach beyond just people who already know him.  
Current gap: He hasn’t established a regular posting schedule or format, so the algorithm isn’t sure who to  
show his content to. The subscriber count is low, so initial views are low, making it hard to snowball.  
Recommendation: Treat YouTube as both an archive and a marketing channel. Every significant piece of  
content he creates (audio or visual) should have some presence on YouTube. For example, even if Mixcloud  
is the main home for an audio mix, he can upload a “visualizer” of the mix to YouTube (with perhaps some  
cool waveform or slideshow of event clips) and SEO-optimize the title (“Zack Bissell – Nostalgia Trap  
(Emotional House DJ Set) \[2024\]”). This way, people searching on YouTube for house mixes might find it. He  
should also fill out video descriptions with relevant keywords (Brooklyn DJ, house mix, disco house, etc.) and  
links to his other profiles. Over time, as he adds more content, his channel will start to appear in related  
video suggestions.  
10Also important: Official Artist Channel (OAC) integration. As soon as possible, Zack (through VerseOne or  
directly) should request YouTube to merge his channels and give him the OAC badge 5  
. This will unify  
content and subscribers – for instance, “Meridian” would show up on his main channel under a Music tab,  
and his channel will get the music note icon. This not only looks professional but also boosts the channel’s  
authority in YouTube’s eyes. It may even pull together his topic channel’s subscribers (if any) into his base.  
Trend: YouTube is increasingly a place where electronic music fans listen to DJ sets (just as much as  
SoundCloud). Many use YouTube’s auto-generated mixes or find Boiler Room sets, etc. While Zack doesn’t  
have those big-brand sets yet, he can still position his content to be found. The SEO aspect is key: use  
descriptive titles and thumbnails. Right now, a video titled “Disco Ascension Live” with no context might not  
grab attention – adding a bit like “Disco Ascension: Live at Broken Land (Storytelling House Set)” could catch  
48  
eyes .  
Brutal truth: At present, Zack’s YouTube is not living up to its potential and is not contributing much to his  
discoverability. It’s largely a repository that only people who already know him might visit. He should pivot  
to make it a discovery platform: more content (even repurposed content), more keyword optimization, and  
leverage Shorts. It may not explode overnight, but it sets foundations. And given YouTube search results  
already show his channel in Google 49  
, improving it will improve what people see when they search his  
name (e.g., seeing a professional channel with a cohesive set of videos rather than a nearly empty one).  
•  
•  
•  
Mixcloud & SoundCloud: These two are grouped because they form the core of Zack’s content output  
(his mixes and music) and have overlapping issues. Mixcloud has been Zack’s haven for full DJ mixes  
due to its legal-friendly platform. He’s had success here: multiple mixes uploaded (18), chart  
placements, and a small community of 150 followers who likely are his most dedicated listeners. He  
also monetized via Select which is forward-thinking. SoundCloud, on the other hand, is more of a  
legacy platform for him – originally used during his Sacramento days (with band references in his old  
bio) and now repurposed to host “Meridian” and some mixes. It has \~89 followers and likely some  
casual listeners who stumble upon his tracks 9  
. The gap: Maintaining two platforms with the same  
content can split plays and attention. Also, SoundCloud runs the risk of content takedowns (if his  
mixes include copyrighted tracks, they might get flagged eventually). So far, it appears his mixes  
from 2024 are still up, meaning either SoundCloud hasn’t flagged them or he’s flying under the radar.  
Strategy analysis:  
Mixcloud clearly aligns better with his needs (unlimited mix length, charts, subscription option). It is  
where he should drive his fans for mix listening. In fact, his website and bio links emphasize  
35  
Mixcloud for “exclusive content” .  
SoundCloud is still important for reach – many general music fans search SoundCloud and might  
find him. Also, SoundCloud allows downloads (if he enables) which some fans appreciate. And since  
he does have original music (Meridian), SoundCloud acts as a home for those where people expect  
to find tracks.  
Recommendation/Pivot: Use SoundCloud primarily for original productions, remixes, or shorter  
promotional mixes, and use Mixcloud for the full-length storytelling DJ sets. This way, he’s not doubling  
effort and each platform has a clear role. For example, he could post a 30-minute “teaser cut” of Nostalgia  
Trap on SoundCloud (which might avoid copyright strikes if shorter and can act as an appetiser) with a note  
“Hear the full 1-hour journey on Mixcloud \-\> \[link\].” Meanwhile, the full version sits on Mixcloud safely  
gathering plays and comments. For original tracks like “Meridian” or future releases, definitely put them on  
SoundCloud (that’s where listeners and even A\&R folks often scout new artists). He should also tag  
11everything thoroughly (e.g., tag genres: “House, Disco, Indie Dance” etc., and use descriptions to tell the  
story of the mix – which he’s good at, as seen in his site copy).  
Also, engage more on both platforms: follow other artists, repost tracks he likes, comment on others’ mixes  
– this kind of community interaction can bring some attention back to his profile (particularly on  
SoundCloud which still has active user engagement in niches).  
Trends: Mixcloud has a smaller user base than SoundCloud but very devoted, especially for radio shows and  
DJ sets. Zack’s charting indicates he can climb ranks in niche genres – he should continue to leverage that by  
picking appropriate tags for his mixes (as he did with “dance-punk”, “indie dance” etc.). Each time he charts,  
it increases his visibility on the platform (people browsing charts see his name). SoundCloud’s trend is more  
towards original music and remixes; fewer people go there for hour-long mixes now. So Zack focusing each  
platform on what it does best is both time-saving and efficient for audience growth.  
Brutal take: Right now, Zack’s presence on these audio platforms is decent but could be sharper. The slight  
branding confusion (two places for mixes) and lack of aggressive promotion means he’s not maximizing  
plays. By consolidating effort (and perhaps gently migrating SoundCloud followers to Mixcloud via  
announcements), he can build one strong funnel instead of two middling ones.

Resident Advisor / Events: While not a “social media” in the traditional sense, RA and live event  
listings deserve mention in terms of Zack’s engagement with the scene. The audit finds that Zack has  
been active in performing live (multiple events in early 2025), but where’s the content from those  
events? Social media thrives on IRL to URL conversion – meaning, taking the live experience and  
broadcasting it online. Zack should ensure that for every significant event, he’s creating content to  
share:  
Live photos, short clips, or even post-event reflections (a Thread about “last night’s warehouse party  
felt like stepping into 1994 for real…”).  
Encouraging attendees to tag him in their stories (building some grassroots promotion).  
Posting the RA event link in advance on his socials to drive RSVPs (he has done some of this on IG  
from what we see).  
There’s also an opportunity to engage with Bandsintown/RA followers by posting updates or comments.  
Bandsintown allows messaging to “Trackers” (if he had any) about new shows. RA allows adding mixes or  
media to his artist page – for example, linking a SoundCloud mix or YouTube video so it appears on RA  
profile. He should do that: RA profile can showcase a Mixcloud link or a recent press article; utilizing that  
feature can turn RA into a mini-EPK for promoters who come across him.  
Gaps: His RA followers count (2) shows he’s not actively converting party-goers into online followers on RA.  
At shows, maybe mention “follow me on RA or IG for updates” on the mic or visually. It’s a minor thing but  
building RA followers can help secure future bookings (promoters see an engaged RA profile).  
Also, consider diversifying event platforms: Are his events listed on local Facebook events or other sites  
like EDM Train? (Edmtrain covers NYC events – if he’s not listed there, he might want to submit any public  
shows; it’s another discovery avenue for event-goers.) The SEO of event listings means when someone  
searches his name \+ “tickets” or “events”, those pages come up (Spotify even had a ticket link via an  
integration 50  
). So making sure all events have an online footprint is key for SEO around his live  
performance aspect.  
12Summary of Gaps & Remedies: In plain terms, Zack’s social media presence is rich in content but  
lacking in optimization and consistency. He has the raw materials: a distinct persona, plenty of creative  
output, and a foot in all relevant platforms. The shortcomings are mainly in execution – e.g., not adapting  
content style to platform (too many static posts on a video-first IG; too few TikToks; no engagement on  
acquired followers in Threads), and not fully controlling his narrative on streaming platforms (unclaimed  
profiles with no bios). The trend is that whenever Zack leans into his unique strengths (story-driven content,  
tying music to narrative and culture), he gets positive feedback (Mixcloud charts, TikTok virality). Where he  
“drops off” is when he fails to consistently deliver that or goes quiet for stretches.  
Key recommendations to revive or pivot:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Embrace short-form video across the board – repackage the storytelling into reels, TikToks, and  
shorts frequently. This is the \#1 way to revive stagnating social metrics in 2025\.  
Schedule regular content: For example, commit to one mix drop or live set upload per month (so  
there’s always something to promote), with weekly smaller posts in between (a throwback clip, a  
“track of the week” he’s loving, etc.). A content calendar will prevent the feast-or-famine posting  
pattern.  
Cross-pollinate audiences: Use each platform to push to the others strategically. Tweet the TikTok  
video, put the TikTok on IG Stories, tell TikTok viewers to check IG for full photos, etc. Right now, each  
channel feels a bit siloed.  
Refresh visuals and branding periodically: His branding is strong (brutalist, high-contrast aesthetic,  
as per Lab Obsidian ethos 47  
). Make sure that’s reflected – e.g., update profile pictures/banners to a  
consistent image or logo across all socials. Little things like a fresh logo on his SoundCloud and  
YouTube can signal that he’s active and professional (the EPK/brand system likely has these assets).  
Engage with followers: Social media is two-way. Reply to comments, ask questions in captions,  
maybe do an IG Live Q\&A or TikTok Live DJ session. If fans feel a dialogue, they’re more likely to stick  
around and advocate for him.  
Monitor analytics: brutally, if some platform isn’t growing at all (say Twitter by end of year still has  
\<100 followers), consider if it’s worth maintaining or if it should just auto-post updates via a linked  
account. Conversely, if TikTok suddenly jumps to 1000 followers because of a trend, prioritize that  
with extra content.  
In conclusion, Zack’s social media could use a shot of adrenaline – largely through video content and  
interactive storytelling – to match the energy of his in-person performances. He has to show online  
why his sets are “unforgettable journeys” 51  
. The content and stories are within him; the task is to translate  
that consistently into platform-appropriate posts. By doing so, he can turn his relatively scattered online  
presence into a cohesive, engaging narrative that draws in new fans and keeps the old ones excited.  
SEO Analysis – Keywords, Discoverability & Opportunities  
In this section, we shift to SEO: how discoverable is Zack online, and how he can improve his visibility on  
search engines and within platform search results. Given that Zack is an emerging artist, a lot of his traffic  
will be branded searches (people who hear his name and search “Zack Bissell”). We need to ensure those  
searches yield a robust, positive first impression, and also identify any non-branded keywords where Zack  
could capture interest (e.g., genre-related searches, local DJ queries). Additionally, we consider SEO not just  
on Google, but on YouTube (second largest search engine) and even Spotify search.  
13Current Search Presence (Google): A Google search for “Zack Bissell” currently returns a mixed but  
improving set of results. Thanks to his efforts in distribution and press: \- His Spotify artist page is a top  
result 52 53 54  
. \- Instagram profile often shows up, as do SoundCloud and Facebook pages . \- His official  
website (zackbissell.com), with its SEO title “Innovative DJ | Immersive Mixes & Live Sets – Zack Bissell,” is  
indexed and appears in results 55  
. It might not be the very first hit yet (Spotify/IG might outrank due to  
their domain strength), but it’s on page one. \- Resident Advisor appears with his upcoming events and  
likely a snippet from his bio 56  
. \- There are also some odd results like a Twitter search or a random  
mention (e.g., an unrelated person or a very old tweet) 57  
, which indicates that Zack’s digital footprint is  
still filling out – the more authoritative content about him that goes online, the more those irrelevant  
entries will be pushed out.  
Overall, for branded search “Zack Bissell,” the results are okay but can be improved by focusing on: \- Getting  
Zack’s own site to rank at or near the top (likely with more backlinks and consistent updates). \- Possibly  
creating a Wikipedia or MusicBrainz entry to trigger a Knowledge Panel (though Wikipedia requires  
notability – might be a stretch right now unless more press comes). \- Ensuring all top results are ones he  
controls or that accurately reflect his image (right now they mostly do: Spotify, IG, SC, RA – all good; maybe  
the Facebook snippet could be better if it showed his tagline instead of a partial post).  
Keyword and Content Opportunities: Beyond people searching his name, how can Zack attract new  
eyeballs via search? Here are some angles: \- Genre and Scene Keywords: Zack is involved in house, disco,  
indie dance scenes in Brooklyn. People do search for things like “Best house DJs in Brooklyn” or “Brooklyn  
disco house set”. It’s niche, but Zack could capture some of that. For instance, if his website had a blog  
section where he writes short articles or even listicles (e.g., “5 Must-Hear Disco-Infused House Sets This  
Month” featuring one of his), those could rank for genre queries. Or simply optimizing his site’s copy with  
those keywords: his homepage already mentions he blends house, disco, indie dance 58  
– that’s good SEO-  
wise for those terms combined with “DJ Brooklyn”. We can strengthen it by adding a bit of copy like  
“Brooklyn house music DJ” in headings or page titles. Right now his tagline is “Brooklyn’s storytelling DJ &  
sonic architect” 51  
– poetic, but not a literal search term someone might use. Perhaps adding a subtitle or  
meta description with “house music, disco, indie dance, DJ in Brooklyn” could help Google associate those  
searches with him. \- Track/Mix Titles: People might search the names of his mixes or projects. For example,  
“Nostalgia Trap mix” or “Disco Ascension Zack Bissell”. Ensuring that his site has dedicated pages or at least  
sections for each major mix with those exact titles (which it does in the “Flagship mixes” section) is great  
59  
60  
. Additionally, having those mixes on YouTube with those titles increases the chance those queries find  
something. The SEO opportunity is to solidify Zack as the top result for any unique project name he creates.  
So far, if one searches “Disco Ascension Zack Bissell,” likely RA or his site or Mixcloud comes up – we want  
his site to be the definitive source. Perhaps a blog post about “The making of Disco Ascension” would  
further cement that while also being interesting content. \- Local SEO for events/gigs: If someone in NYC  
searches “Broken Land DJ Saturday” or “Bushwick DJ residency,” will Zack appear? Possibly via RA or a  
Facebook event. To capture these, Zack could do a couple things: list his residency venues and schedule on  
his site (maybe under a “Tour” or “Events” page that is indexed). His current site’s “Tour” section is a bit  
minimal (the navigation has a Tour page, but it may just prompt to join a mailing list or link to  
Bandsintown). Having an actual text listing of upcoming events on the site (with city, venue, date) will let  
Google pick that up for local queries. Also, Google has started showing event listings in search results (via  
schema markup or via pulling from services like Bandsintown or Songkick). By keeping Bandsintown  
updated, he indirectly feeds Google’s event listings. So from an SEO perspective, maintaining those entries  
means if someone Googles “Zack Bissell tickets” they might see a nice Google Events card with his next  
show. \- Name Confusion/Overlap: The audit should consider if there are any other notable “Zack Bissell”  
14online. It seems there was a search result for a high schooler or another person with the same name on  
Twitter 61  
, and possibly alternate spellings (Zach vs Zack). If “Zach Bissell” is searched, does Zack’s stuff still  
show? Maybe not as well. An opportunity is to include a mention of the alternate spelling on his site (“Zack  
(not Zach) ”) or run a small Google Ad for his name that catches those variants. But that might be overkill;  
generally, the name is distinct enough. \- Music Release SEO: When someone searches a track like “Meridian  
Zack Bissell”, ideally the top results should be an official source (Spotify or his site). Right now, the DSP audit  
noted that direct links for some platforms require search (Spotify, YouTube Music) 43 4  
. To boost this, he  
can create a page on his site specifically for Meridian – e.g., a blog post or press release with the title  
“Meridian – Debut Single by Zack Bissell Out Now” and some SEO copy (mentioning “stream Meridian on  
Spotify, Apple Music” etc.). That way, Google has a relevant page to show beyond just the Spotify link. He  
62  
can also use the Spotify Promo Cards or SmartURL (like he has a Spotify promocard URL in the EPK )  
widely – posting that on socials and press so that more backlinks to it appear. \- Backlinks and Domain  
Authority: One reason Spotify outranks Zack’s own site is because zackbissell.com is new and has few  
backlinks (other sites linking to it). To improve SEO, he should aim to get more references from other sites.  
Some ways: \- Press articles or interviews: Pitch a local music blog or even Medium article about him – any  
write-up with a link helps. His EPK mentions “Featured by Mixcloud and VerseOne” 31  
– if Mixcloud wrote a  
blurb on him or tweeted about his chart success, maybe ensure his site link is there. \- Collaborative content:  
e.g., write a guest blog on a music site about storytelling in DJing, with a link back to his site. \- Ensure that  
on all his profiles that allow a website link (RA, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, YouTube, etc.), he has  
zackbissell.com listed (most do). These are no-follow sometimes but still important for referral traffic. \- Lab  
Obsidian (his label) site or projects should link to him too. If Lab Obsidian has its own domain or page, make  
sure it references Zack as an artist with a link.  
Over time, these will raise his site’s visibility on Google.  
Platform-Specific Search (Algorithmic SEO): \- Spotify search: When a user searches “Zack Bissell” on  
Spotify, he comes up (especially now that he has an official release). More interesting is appearing in  
searches for general terms on Spotify like “Brooklyn house” or being included in playlists. To improve his  
Spotify SEO: \- Once he claims his profile, he should add a compelling Spotify bio that includes searchable  
keywords and maybe mentions Brooklyn/House, etc. (Spotify’s search isn’t as text-based as Google, but it  
can help for the algorithm and certainly for user impression). \- Use Spotify’s tools: create public playlists of  
tracks that inspire him (including his own track) so that his profile shows activity. \- Encourage followers on  
Spotify (e.g., through a Spotify follow link on his pages). A higher follower count can influence the algorithm  
slightly and at least gets listeners notified of new releases. \- When more music comes, make sure to use  
Spotify for Artists to pitch songs to editorial playlists. This is more music marketing than SEO, but  
ultimately being on popular playlists will cause more people to search his name.  
•  
YouTube search: Already discussed – optimize video titles, descriptions, and engage with  
comments. Perhaps also comment as his channel on related videos (e.g., comment something  
thoughtful on a popular disco house mix video – people do click channel names from comments if  
they’re curious).  
•  
SoundCloud search: Ensure tracks have descriptive names and tags. SoundCloud’s search might  
find his mixes if tagged well (e.g., someone searching “disco house mix” could find Disco Ascension if  
that phrase is in the description or tags). He should double-check that. Also, the bio on SoundCloud  
should be updated to focus on his current music style and location (he did update to Brooklyn, which  
is good).  
15•  
Hashtags and keywords on social: While not traditional SEO, using consistent hashtags like  
\#ZackBissell \#HouseMusic \#DiscoHouse on platforms like Instagram/TikTok can help people  
discover him via in-app search. It looks like he does hashtag relevant things on TikTok (e.g.  
\#brooklyn \#housemusic 22  
) – he should continue and maybe standardize a personal hashtag  
(\#StorytellingDJ or something unique, though that might be more for branding than discovery).  
SEO for Narrative and Branding: Because Zack’s differentiator is his narrative approach, he might consider  
publishing content that highlights that in ways search engines pick up: \- A well-written bio page on his site  
(which he has) – maybe expand it with a paragraph explicitly mentioning his background (ex-Broadway  
actor, etc.), because those are unique terms that if someone hears about (“DJ who was a Broadway actor”), a  
search could lead to him if it’s mentioned. Right now his bio on site and EPK does mention Broadway and  
such 63  
. Good. \- Possibly a blog series on his site (or Medium) about the concept behind each mix (e.g.,  
“Inside ‘Nostalgia Trap’: How heartbreak and blocked exes inspired a \#1 mix”). These not only provide great  
material to share on social (driving traffic to site), but also serve SEO queries (someone searching anything  
related to emotional DJ sets or that mix name will find this). \- Collaborations and names: He’s collaborated  
with a few known figures (DJ CherishTheLuv, Jasmine Solano, Just Blaze as per EPK 64  
). A clever SEO move:  
mention those in context on his site (which EPK likely does). If someone googles “Just Blaze Jasmine Solano  
Zack Bissell”, something should come up (maybe a recap of the event they all played). Right now that info is  
in his press kit, but putting out a public blog or post about those collabs could attract those searching those  
bigger names and find him by association.  
Fixing Any SEO Issues: One thing to check is that his website is technically sound – e.g., mobile-friendly,  
fast, and has proper meta tags. Since the site is custom (GitHub code), he should ensure meta descriptions  
55  
are set (the search snippet suggests it is: “Dive into immersive stories through music at ZackBissell.com.” –  
that’s good). Also adding schema markup could be beneficial: for example, JSON-LD schema for  
“MusicalArtist” with his name, genre, hometown, and sameAs links to all his profiles. This can help Google’s  
knowledge graph. If he’s not familiar, a developer or even a tool like Google’s Structured Data Markup  
Helper can assist. It’s a bit technical, but it’s the kind of polish that could set him apart (few indie DJs will  
have that, so it might eventually help trigger a knowledge panel when he’s borderline notable).  
Discoverability in the Industry: Aside from fan searches, SEO can help with industry visibility: \-  
MusicBrainz & Jaxsta: As noted in the DSP audit, adding data to MusicBrainz (an open music encyclopedia)  
and Jaxsta (official credits database) is recommended 65 66  
. By adding an entry on MusicBrainz for Zack  
Bissell (with his releases and basic info), he increases the chance that Google’s knowledge panels or future  
AI search results include a verified profile, since Google often pulls from MusicBrainz/Wikidata for lesser-  
known artists. Jaxsta listing him (especially if his distributor or label gets credits in) will ensure if someone is  
searching in a professional context (“Zack Bissell credits”), they see official info. \- SoundExchange  
registration (mentioned in audit docs) doesn’t impact SEO, but it’s good for royalties. Just to note, he  
67  
should do that for behind-the-scenes completeness .  
Keyword Brainstorm relevant to Zack: \- “storytelling DJ” – a term he uses. SEO volume might be low, but  
he’s basically owning that term in his branding. Continue to push it – maybe he can become synonymous  
with it. \- “immersive DJ set” – similar concept, ensure those words appear around his name on his site or  
YouTube descriptions. \- “disco house mix 2025”, “indie dance DJ set” – target these by using them in titles or  
tags on Mixcloud/YouTube. People do search by year and genre on YouTube especially. \- “Brooklyn DJ events”  
– if he posts event recaps or announcements with location keywords, he might catch local searchers looking  
for something to do (though competition from bigger event sites is high). \- Mix titles and unique concepts like  
16“Groove Singularity” (which he mentioned as inspiration in his mix description 68  
). That term is unique – he  
should capitalize on it by maybe writing a fun piece about it. If that becomes a hook, anyone hearing it will  
attribute it to him via search. \- Lab Obsidian – his label/collective. Searching that currently might only show  
minimal info. He should have at least a page on his site or a separate site with info on Lab Obsidian (even if  
it’s just his own project). If any collaborators or projects come out under it, those should link back to him.  
Essentially, ensure Lab Obsidian and Zack Bissell are interlinked in content so one search leads to the other.  
Competitive/Comparative SEO: Consider peers – e.g., other local DJs or artists with similar styles. See what  
they do. If a DJ with a bit more fame (say someone like Eli Escobar in NYC house scene) has a Wikipedia or  
appears on certain sites, those are avenues for Zack too in time. Even things like podcasts or interviews:  
perhaps Zack could get on a niche music podcast – those often have show notes that appear in search.  
Proactively seeking those out can generate content that boosts SEO (plus it’s promotional in itself).  
Lastly, monitoring: Zack should set up Google Alerts for his name and major mix titles. This way he knows  
when a blog or site mentions him, and he can then capitalize on that (e.g., share it, or ensure they link his  
site). It also helps catch any negative or incorrect info that might pop up so he can address it (though none  
seen now, but as he grows, one negative review or comment could appear – best to stay ahead).  
SEO Bottom Line: Zack’s digital presence will benefit from a more intentional SEO strategy. The key steps: 1\.  
Claim and optimize all artist profiles on DSPs (to control content and cross-link to his website) 3 4  
. 2\.  
Strengthen his website’s content and metadata with targeted keywords (without losing the creative  
voice). Possibly add a news/updates section for fresh content. 3\. Leverage content marketing (stories,  
blog posts, videos) around his unique selling points (narrative, immersive mixes) to capture niche searches  
and build backlinks. 4\. Use structured data and ensure all profiles link back to create a strong  
interconnected web that search algorithms recognize. 5\. Maintain consistency – SEO is not a one-time task  
but an ongoing process of updating content, building links, and adjusting to how people search. For  
instance, if he notices more search hits for “Nostalgia Trap reality slap” after it charted, maybe he makes  
that a heading on his site or a YouTube video title to match demand.  
By implementing these, Zack can significantly improve his discoverability. Instead of only being found by  
those who already know him, he’ll start to attract those who are searching generally for the kind of  
experience he offers – and when they find him, the breadth of his online content (mixes, videos, write-ups)  
will tell a compelling story that can convert searchers into fans.  
Tools & Aggregation – Building a Unified Digital Presence (Post-  
Squarespace)  
Zack previously used Squarespace (implied by “post-Squarespace” in the prompt) for his website or link-in-  
bio. Now, with a custom site live and multiple profiles, it’s crucial to have a single aggregation point for  
fans to find everything and for Zack to easily update his info across platforms. Currently, he’s using bio.site  
as a link aggregator 69  
– which is a good solution (it’s basically LinkTree-like, and his bio.site page is nicely  
populated with links and even embedded content like recent IG posts and Mixcloud listings 70 71  
). Let’s  
evaluate this and other options:  
•  
Bio.site (or Linktree): The advantage is simplicity – one link in Instagram/TikTok bio that leads to all  
important links. Zack’s bio.site is pretty robust: it lists his website, RA, Bandsintown, Mixcloud,  
17•  
•  
SoundCloud, YouTube, etc., and even showcases recent Instagram posts and a “Mixes and Live Sets”  
gallery of Mixcloud links 70 71  
. This is actually a great interim solution after dropping Squarespace.  
It ensures if someone clicks his IG bio, they can get to whichever platform they prefer to follow/  
consume (choices are good for fans). One downside: it’s another thing to update. Zack’s done well  
keeping it current (e.g., it references nostalgia trap hitting \#1 on Mixcloud 72  
, which is very current  
info). If Zack can commit to updating bio.site whenever he has a new link or achievement, it’s  
perfectly fine to continue using. However, bio.site is a third-party platform; some may prefer  
Linktree or similar for analytics or design flexibility. Also, bio.site might not be as known – but since  
it’s working, there’s no urgent need to switch. Alternatives:  
Linktree: Very similar functionally. Zack could use Linktree which is more popular; however, his  
bio.site already does the job and looks unique (and is free). Unless he wants features Linktree has  
(like integration with mailing lists or more themes), there’s no strong reason to switch.  
Solo.to, Carrd, etc.: Many link-in-bio tools exist. Each with slight variations. Again, his current setup  
is fine.  
•  
.bio site vs. building his own directory: The question hints at possibly a “Claude-built directory site”  
or using Claude (an AI) to maintain the guide. Since Zack is tech-savvy enough to have a GitHub for  
his site, one could consider embedding the link directory into his own website. For example, instead of  
relying on bio.site, he could have zackbissell.com/bio or just the homepage serve as the link hub.  
Right now, his site is more elaborate (with mix descriptions, etc.), which might overwhelm someone  
who just wants quick links. One idea: Framer or Notion as alternatives –  
•  
•  
•  
Framer is a website builder that could make a very sleek one-page site combining his branding and  
links. If his current custom site ever becomes too cumbersome to update for quick changes, Framer  
is an option to rebuild a simpler site (it’s designer-friendly and code-optional).  
Notion can be used to create a public page that acts as an electronic press kit or link directory. For  
instance, a Notion page with sections (Bio, Links, Upcoming Shows, Press Photos) could be an all-in-  
one for industry folks. It’s not as pretty for general fans though.  
A Claude-loadable guide or mini app spec – this sounds like using AI to generate an interactive  
FAQ or directory. Potentially, one could feed all his links and bio to an AI chatbot (like a “virtual  
assistant” for Zack’s brand). That’s a cutting-edge idea: fans could ask a chatbot “When’s Zack’s next  
show?” or “Where can I hear his disco mix?” and it responds with the info and links. This might be  
what the prompt suggests for Claude (Anthropic’s AI) – building a mini app that Zack can reuse. It’s a  
bit experimental for an artist, but actually a cool concept given Zack’s tech-forward approach (he did  
brand himself a “sonic architect” after all).  
Practically, though, the simpler approach is to maintain a well-structured Notion or Markdown document  
internally that lists all assets (similar to what we did above), so he or his team can easily update multiple  
platforms. Perhaps the deliverable of this audit itself, in a structured way, serves that purpose.  
•  
•  
•  
Aggregation Tools for Content: Beyond links, Zack might consider tools that aggregate content or  
analytics:  
For social posting, using something like Buffer or Later to schedule posts across Instagram, Twitter,  
Facebook can save time and ensure consistency.  
For monitoring, tools like Hootsuite or even the native Meta Suite can keep track of comments/  
messages in one place.  
18•  
For music, Linkfire or Hypeddit could be used when he releases tracks or mixes – these create one  
smart URL that directs users based on preference (like a landing page for “Listen to Meridian” with  
buttons for Spotify, Apple, SoundCloud, etc.). This is good for marketing campaigns and also tracks  
clicks per platform.  
•  
Backup Options: It’s mentioned “backup options e.g. .bio site, LinkTree alternatives, or mini Claude-  
built directory.” This suggests ensuring that if one platform fails or if he wants more control, he has a  
backup. For instance:  
•  
•  
•  
Maintaining a simple HTML/text version of his EPK or links (maybe on his site) that can be quickly  
updated if a service goes down.  
Exporting his contact/fan list (if he uses mailing list or something) regularly so he always owns that  
data.  
Archiving his content – e.g., downloading all Instagram content somewhere safe, or keeping local  
copies of his mixes and track metadata. This is more digital hygiene but relevant (imagine if  
SoundCloud terminated his account – does he have all the follower data or at least knowledge of  
who to tell? Not really, so having fans on multiple platforms acts as a backup in itself).  
•  
Post-Squarespace migration: We should ensure all traces of the old Squarespace site (if any)  
redirect to the new site or bio. If Zack’s domain was the same (likely yes, he just rebuilt it), then it’s  
fine. But if he had a .squarespace.com address or old links, he might want to set up redirects or  
inform search engines of the change. Since his new site is up and indexed, it seems fine. Just double-  
check:  
•  
•  
Google search console can be used to request removal of any outdated Squarespace pages if they  
linger in results.  
If any partner sites (like a venue page, etc.) still link to an old site, reach out to update the link.  
•  
Brand Consistency and Ease of Use: The ultimate goal of aggregation is to make it dead-simple for  
anyone – fan or industry – to find what they need. With that in mind, Zack should consider having  
two main public entry points:  
•  
•  
One for fans: likely his link-in-bio page or website homepage with clear navigation.  
One for press/industry: perhaps a dedicated page or Notion with downloadable media kit, high-res  
photos, short bio, links to important profiles (already largely covered by his EPK PDF and press  
section on site).  
Right now, his bio.site is serving fans, and the EPK (PDF or in Google Doc) is for press. It might be useful to  
host a press page on his website (so press Googling him don’t have to find a PDF via user files – they likely  
won’t, but maybe he sends it out directly). A “Press” section with the quotes, achievements, and a link to  
73  
download media kit would be perfect. I see in his site menu there is “Press” and “EPK/Bio” pages listed –  
he likely intends to have those. Making sure those pages are live and populated will take the burden off the  
PDF (PDFs aren’t SEO-friendly). Perhaps he’s already on it given the GitHub code shows those pages.  
•  
Claude or AI usage: Zack (or his team) could use AI like Claude to keep content fresh or generate  
quick posts based on an outline. For example, feeding Claude bullet points of an event and getting a  
19nicely written recap to post. But that’s more content creation than aggregation. The mention of a  
“Claude-loadable guide or mini app spec” suggests maybe packaging this audit’s info into a format  
an AI could use to answer questions (like the chatbot idea). We might provide, say, a structured JSON  
of his profiles and details:  
{  
"profiles": {  
"Instagram": "https://instagram.com/zack.bissell",  
"Spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/...",  
...  
},  
"bio": "Zack Bissell is a Brooklyn-based DJ ...",  
"latest\_release": "Meridian (single, Mar 18 2025)",  
"upcoming\_shows": \["Every Sat at Broken Land, Brooklyn", "Jul 30 2025 at  
Elsewhere"\]  
}  
– That could be fed to an AI to keep knowledge updated. It’s a very forward-thinking approach to  
content management. Possibly beyond the scope of this report to include raw JSON, but something  
to mention to him as an idea. Since the user specifically mentioned “Claude-ready,” perhaps they do  
want a structured block in the answer. However, the guidelines say we should keep it readable in  
Markdown, so maybe not full JSON. A compromise is we’ve given a clearly structured link directory  
and inventory in bullet form which is easy to copy. If needed, that can be quickly transformed into  
another format.  
•  
Choosing the Right Tools: If Zack is hands-on (seems like it), he might enjoy using new tools. If not,  
he should pick one aggregator and stick with it to avoid confusion. The audit of his current approach  
(bio.site \+ custom site \+ various socials) suggests complexity, but he’s managing. We should caution:  
simplify where possible. For instance, do we need both bio.site and a full website? Potentially, the  
website could itself act as the link hub on mobile (just design a mobile-friendly landing section).  
However, the website is heavier to load and not as instantly clickable as a link list. One idea: have the  
best of both – embed a “linktree” style section on the site’s homepage. E.g., when someone visits on  
mobile, show big buttons for Spotify, Instagram, etc., above the fold. That way he can in the future  
just promote zackbissell.com everywhere (no middleman service). But until his site is fully tuned for  
that, bio.site is a fine solution.  
Backup and Fallbacks: In case of any platform issue (account hack, etc.), Zack should keep a direct line to  
fans – the classic method is an email newsletter. Does he have one? Possibly not yet. Given his emphasis  
on modern channels, email might feel old-school, but it is the one channel he can own. Even if it’s just  
collecting emails for announcing big releases or shows, it’s a safety net. If tomorrow Instagram banned his  
account erroneously, how would he tell 1.4k followers? If he had 100 of their emails from past Bandcamp  
purchases or a signup form, he could reach them. His site’s contact form likely is just for bookings, not a  
mailing list. So perhaps set up a simple “Subscribe for updates” on his site or link page. This is an often  
overlooked but important part of one’s digital strategy. Not to mention, it’s good for re-engagement (say  
he’s dropping an EP next year, an email blast could help boost day-one listens).  
20Claude AI Mini-app idea (blue-sky): The notion of a mini Claude-built directory or guide is intriguing. For  
example, building a conversational FAQ chatbot on his site (“Ask me about my music”). To implement, one  
could feed an AI with this audit and other context. However, that’s not standard yet on artist sites (and  
might confuse users). It might be more useful internally – e.g., Zack feeding his info to Claude to generate  
press releases or tweets on demand. If he has access to such AI, he can use this data as a knowledge base.  
Since the prompt explicitly mentions it, they might want a structured block output.  
Given readability concerns, I’ll keep our response narrative, but in an appendix or somewhere, we could  
include a structured content block (like a YAML or bullet list, which we did in link directory). We have done  
the link directory and profile inventory in a structured way, which likely satisfies that requirement.  
If needed, one more structured section can be “Data Snapshot for Re-use” where we list key info in a brief  
semi-structured way: \- Name, Genre, Location \- Followers on each platform \- Key links \- etc.  
This can be easily input to an AI or adapted. But this may be redundant now. The directory we provided is  
quite detailed and structured in Markdown.  
Branding-Ready Layout: We have used clear headings, lists, etc., which makes it easy to adapt to a  
polished document. If Zack were to put this audit into Notion or another tool, the headings and lists will  
convert well. The tone we’ve kept is professional but straightforward, and “brutal in clarity” as requested  
(we didn’t shy from pointing out low numbers or needed improvements, albeit respectfully).  
Finally, we should ensure the tone remains constructive. Brutal honesty doesn’t mean negativity for its  
own sake. We pointed out shortcomings but also provided actionable strategies. This way, the audit isn’t  
just critical but actually useful for Zack to move forward.  
To conclude, we might summarize the big-picture: Zack has built a solid foundation online with widespread  
presence; now the task is to connect the dots, fill the gaps, and consistently engage. By doing so, his  
SEO will improve organically (because engaged platforms lead to more shares, more mentions), and his  
social following will grow (leading to more music streams, etc.). This synergy between social activity and  
search visibility is what will elevate him from being just “searchable if you know him” to “discoverable even  
if you don’t.”
