**Nostalgia Trap: A DJ Mix for the Emotionally Unstable**  
**Opening Narrative: The Emotional Minefield**  
Let’s be real: this isn’t for everyone. Hell, it might not even be for you. But if you’re here, you’re  
probably feeling some type of way about someone you can’t shake. Good. That’s the point.  
*Nostalgia Trap* isn’t a timeline. It’s not a set. It’s a therapy session you didn’t ask for, wrapped in  
beats that won’t let you breathe. It’s chaotic. It’s obsessive. It’s the high, the crash, the mess in  
between. You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You might text them. You shouldn’t.  
This mix is for the emotionally unstable—a love letter to the people who’ve ruined us and the  
nights we swore we’d never think about them again. But here we are, haunted by a melody,  
wondering what they’re up to. So press play, think about that person, and let yourself spiral. It’s  
cheaper than therapy.  
**Track List and Lore**  
**1\. I Remember – Elderbrook & Purple Disco Machine**  
We kick off with a collaboration that plunges you into introspection. Elderbrook’s soulful vocals  
paired with Purple Disco Machine’s signature groove create a soundscape that feels like  
reminiscing on a love that’s slipped through your fingers. It’s the calm before the storm, luring  
you into the depths of your own mind.  
**2\. Witch Doctor – Crazy P**  
The tempo picks up, and so does the emotional intensity. This isn’t about healing; it’s about the  
frantic search for a cure to the heartache. The pulsating beats mirror the obsessive thoughts that  
won’t let you rest, capturing the chaos of longing and the madness of unrequited desire.  
**3\. London Headache (Purple Disco Machine Remix) – Anabel Englund**  
A slick blend of deep house rhythms and Englund’s ethereal vocals, this track encapsulates the  
realization that the city’s allure can’t mask the pain. It’s the moment you understand that no  
matter where you are, the memories follow—a headache that no amount of escapism can cure.  
**4\. Mvinline (Extended Mix) – Boys Noize**  
The energy surges with this techno-infused banger. It’s the embodiment of losing yourself in the  
club scene, using the pounding bass to drown out the emotional noise. But beneath the surface,  
there’s a tension—a reminder that the high is temporary, and reality waits on the other side.  
**5\. I Feel Love – Sam Smith**A modern rendition of a classic, Sam Smith’s cover brings a haunting vulnerability to the iconic  
track. It’s the euphoric peak of the night, where love feels tangible, almost divine. Yet, there’s an  
underlying fragility, a sense that this bliss is as fleeting as the night itself.  
**6\. At Night (Purple Disco Machine Remix) – Shakedown**  
As the night deepens, this remix delves into the solitude that follows the euphoria. The groove is  
infectious, but the lyrics speak to a loneliness that creeps in when the lights fade. It’s a dance  
with your own shadows, confronting the emptiness that lingers.  
**7\. Little L – Jamiroquai**  
Funky and upbeat, yet laced with lyrics about love gone awry. It’s the realization that what once  
was sweet has turned sour. The “little L” isn’t just love; it’s the lies, the letdowns, and the  
lingering doubts that plague your mind.  
**8\. Money Money – Purple Disco Machine & Pink Flamingo Rhythm Revue**  
A satirical take on materialism in relationships. The catchy melody belies a critique of how love  
can be transactional, questioning the value we place on affection and the cost of emotional  
investments.  
**9\. Heaven (Danny Krivit Edit) – The Vision feat. Andreya Triana**  
A soulful declaration of finding paradise in another person. Triana’s vocals soar, offering a  
glimpse of hope and redemption. It’s the light at the end of the tunnel, suggesting that maybe,  
just maybe, love can be pure and healing.  
**10\. Hold Me Up (Michael Gray Extended Remix) – Junior Jack & Glory**  
A plea for support, masked as a dance floor anthem. The driving beat pushes you forward, but the  
message is clear: without your love, I’m falling apart. It’s the vulnerability we hide behind our  
bravado, laid bare under the disco lights.  
**11\. I Love You Always Forever (Original Mix) – Jackers Revenge**  
Nostalgia hits hard with this reimagined classic. The familiar lyrics evoke memories of innocent  
love, but the revamped production adds a layer of complexity, reflecting how our understanding  
of love evolves—and complicates—as we grow.  
**12\. Last Dance – Satin Jackets & Tensnake**  
The penultimate track brings a bittersweet vibe, signaling the end of the night—and perhaps  
something more. It’s a slow burn, allowing you to savor the final moments before the inevitable  
goodbye.**13\. Inspector Norse – Todd Terje**  
Pure chaos. If you know, you know. This track throws everything into disarray. It’s the sound of  
spiraling—messy, manic, and unrelenting.  
**14\. The Cure and the Cause (Cube Guys Remix) – Fish Go Deep feat. Tracey K**  
What’s the cure? What’s the cause? The duality is maddening. This track feels like pacing back  
and forth, replaying every moment, trying to make sense of something senseless.  
**15\. For Club Play Only/Be Here – Duke Dumont**  
The climax. A celebration of survival, even if you’re crawling to the finish line. The juxtaposition  
between these tracks is the emotional release you didn’t know you needed.  
**16\. Love Is the Message – MFSB**  
The gospel according to disco. It’s an invitation, a reminder that love’s messy, but it’s all we’ve  
got. The mix crescendos here, demanding you let go.  
**17\. I’ll Take You There (Dimitri From Paris Re-Edit) – Frankie Knuckles**  
The finale. A promise, a plea, and a destination. This track ties it all together, leaving you  
somewhere between catharsis and collapse. It’s hopeful, but barely.  
**Marketing Copy: "I Don’t Give a F\* If You Listen"\*\***  
This mix isn’t for you. It’s for the person you can’t stop thinking about. It’s for the nights you  
swore you’d move on but didn’t. *Nostalgia Trap* doesn’t care if you’re ready. It’s here to make  
you feel every bad decision, every “what if,” and every goddamn moment you’d rather forget.  
Put it on. Sit with it. Think about them. Cry. Dance. Do whatever you need to do. Just don’t  
pretend it didn’t wreck you.

2\. **Nostalgia as a Weapon:**  
◦ Every track weaponizes memory, forcing you to relive the highs and lows.3\. **The Unresolved:**

**Promo Narrative: "I Don’t Give a F\* If You Listen"\*\***  
This mix isn’t for everyone. Hell, it might not even be for you. But if you’re the type of person  
who willingly revisits old wounds just to see if they still hurt, then welcome. *Nostalgia Trap* is  
an emotional gut punch dressed up in beats that make you want to dance, cry, and scream into the  
void—sometimes all at once. This isn’t about closure. It’s about reopening the door, pulling out  
the boxes of memories, and letting them spill all over the goddamn floor. It’s messy, chaotic, and  
at times unhinged, but so is life. So is love.  
Press play and think about them—you know who. The one who still lives in your head rent-free,  
the one who shaped you in ways you’re still unpacking. This is your soundtrack for that.  
**Track List and Expanded Lore**  
**1\. So I Remember**  
The opening is introspective, like sitting in a dark room with your thoughts echoing back at you.  
The lyrics cut deep: *I haven’t been the same since then. Maybe you’ve changed at the same pace.*  
*Maybe I’ll see you soon again.* It’s reflective and almost hopeful—but not quite. It’s the  
soundtrack of denial, of clutching onto the belief that they’re still the same person you  
remember.  
**2\. Witch Doctor**  
Obsessive. Chaotic. The kind of longing that keeps you up at night, scrolling through their old  
photos and wishing you could manipulate the universe to bring them back. The beat mimics the  
spiral—hypnotic and relentless. It’s messy, almost desperate, because love’s ugliest moments  
usually are.  
**3\. London Headache**A moment of clarity—the realization that maybe this whole thing is more complicated than it’s  
worth. But the music keeps pulling you back in, like a headache you can’t shake. It’s bittersweet,  
tinged with resignation.  
**4\. MBN Line / I Feel Love**  
This section is pure, euphoric high. Imagine being in the middle of a crowded club, the lights  
blinding and the bass pounding through your chest. You’re with someone who makes you feel  
invincible. But underneath it all, there’s an ache, because deep down you know it’s the drugs, the  
music, the moment—not them.  
**5\. At Night / Little L**  
Loneliness hits harder at night. *At Night* is the quiet introspection that happens when the world  
goes silent, and *Little L* is the realization that the love you had wasn’t what you thought it was.  
It’s not big love, capital L. It’s little love—conditional, fleeting, and, ultimately, disappointing.  
**6\. Money, Money**  
Here’s the ugly truth: love and money are tied together in ways we don’t want to admit. This  
track pulls no punches, examining the transactional nature of relationships with a beat that’s as  
brutal as the truth it delivers.  
**7\. Heaven**  
Walking through the door feels like stepping into the light after spending too long in the dark.  
*Heaven* is that rare moment of clarity, the realization that maybe love can be beautiful—even if  
it’s not forever.  
**8\. Hold Me Up**  
This one’s a plea: *Don’t you want to hold me up with your love?* It’s the quiet desperation of  
needing someone else to be your foundation, even when you know that’s not fair.  
**9\. I Love You Always Forever / Last Dance**  
This pairing is nostalgia at its peak. *I Love You Always Forever* is a sugary sweet anthem to  
eternal love, but the bass swap in *Last Dance* changes everything. Suddenly, the love isn’t  
eternal; it’s ephemeral. *This is our last dance, babes.* It’s tender, heartbreaking, and a little  
resigned.**10\. Inspector Norse**  
Chaotic. Unapologetic. If you know, you know. The chaos mirrors the messy emotional  
undercurrent of the entire mix.  
**11\. The Cure and the Cause / For Club Play Only Be Here**  
The juxtaposition here is stark. *The Cure and the Cause* is about wanting answers, closure,  
something to make sense of it all. But *Be Here* doesn’t give you that. Instead, it pulls you into the  
moment, demanding that you feel everything right now, with no promise of resolution.  
**12\. Love Is the Message / I’ll Take You There**  
The final act. *Love Is the Message* is the epilogue, tying together the themes of the mix: love,  
loss, longing, and fleeting moments of joy. *I’ll Take You There* is the resolution—not closure, but  
acceptance. It’s an invitation to move forward, to find solace on the dance floor, even if just for a  
moment.  
**Themes and Layers**  
1\. **Memory as a Trap:**  
◦ Every track is steeped in nostalgia, pulling you into memories you can’t escape.  
2\. **Love’s Duality:**  
◦ The mix captures love in all its forms: beautiful, messy, euphoric, and devastating.  
3\. **The Dance Floor as a Sanctuary:**  
◦ The club becomes a space where emotions are amplified and distorted, a refuge  
and a trap all at once.  
**Summary**  
*Nostalgia Trap* isn’t just a DJ mix; it’s an emotional odyssey. It doesn’t ask for your permission  
or forgiveness. It’s raw, chaotic, and painfully honest—a reflection of the moments we can’t  
move past. Whether it leaves you crying, dancing, or both, one thing is certain: you’re not  
walking away unchanged.
