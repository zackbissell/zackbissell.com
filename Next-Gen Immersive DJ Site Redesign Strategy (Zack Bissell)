Next-Gen Immersive DJ Site Redesign Strategy
(Zack Bissell)
Vision Overview
The goal is to reinvent Zack Bissell’s online presence into an immersive, story-driven DJ experience with the
polish of a high-end app. This means fully embracing Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a
clean, elegant aesthetic and smooth microinteractions, while layering on the creative, cinematic flair of a
boutique film studio or after-hours event. In practice, the design will favor minimalist layouts, refined
typography (using Apple’s SF Pro or similar for clarity), and fluid transitions that add a sense of depth
without overwhelming the user . Every interactive detail should feel intentional yet unobtrusive – for
example, buttons with gentle haptic-like feedback and icons following a consistent visual language .
These micro-interactions are pivotal: they transform an interface from merely functional to genuinely
enjoyable, while subtly expressing brand personality .
At a high level, the new site will be narrative-centric and “world”-based. Each of Zack’s flagship DJ mixes
becomes its own thematic micro-site or “story world,” complete with unique visuals, copy, and interactive
elements that reflect the mix’s mood. The core vision is a site that feels expensive, cinematic, and polished –
imagine Apple-level attention to detail meets A24’s artistic edge meets the vibe of a well-produced Brooklyn
afterparty. The homepage and global design will establish this luxe, high-impact baseline (think generous
white space, dramatic typography, and subtle motion), while each mix’s section will deviate into its own
immersive aesthetic. Crucially, all of this must be achieved with a mobile-first approach: the experience
should be just as compelling on a phone as on a widescreen, leveraging responsive design to adapt layouts
fluidly to different breakpoints . Accessibility is non-negotiable: high contrast text, proper alt
descriptions, and consideration for screen readers will be baked in from the start (Apple’s guidelines call for
at least a 4.5:1 text contrast for readability ). In summary, the vision marries Apple-grade UX (clarity,
efficiency, inclusivity) with immersive storytelling (bespoke visuals, audio-reactive surprises) to create
a DJ site that is both a polished product and a digital adventure.
User Journey / Navigation Map
We will craft an intuitive yet exploratory user journey that guides visitors through Zack’s content as a
narrative adventure. Below is a high-level flow of how a user might experience the new site:
Landing on Home: A visitor arrives at the homepage and is greeted with a cinematic hero section.
For example, a bold tagline (“It all begins with a story”) fades in with a subtle animation, immediately
communicating the narrative theme. This page establishes the site’s high-end feel – think a clean
Apple-like interface with a hint of motion to draw the eye (e.g. a gentle parallax or fade-in on the
tagline). The navigation menu is minimal and fixed at top, perhaps showing just a logo and a menu
icon or simple links (Home, Mixes/Worlds, About, Contact) in an elegant font. The user quickly
perceives that this is not a typical DJ homepage but a portal into different stories.

Scanning Featured Mix “Worlds”: Scrolling down the home page reveals a featured mixes section
showcasing the flagship DJ mixes as entry points to their “worlds.” Each mix is represented by a
preview card with thematic imagery and a teaser description. For instance, the “Disco Ascension”
card might show a surreal, retro-futuristic graphic with a “CLASSIFIED” warning badge motif
(echoing its conspiracy theme) and a subheading like “A Disco House Paradox.” Similarly, “Nostalgia
Trap” might be previewed with a moody, intimate image and a tag like “For the Emotionally
Unstable.” These cards likely use a hover or tap microinteraction – e.g. hovering could slightly
animate the card (scale up or a shimmer effect) to indicate interactivity. The user can swipe (on
mobile) or scroll through these feature cards, which are presented in a mobile-friendly carousel or
stacked layout. This section essentially acts as a narrative menu, inviting the user to choose their
journey.
Entering a Mix World: When the user clicks or taps on a specific mix (e.g. Nostalgia Trap), instead of
a jarring page load, a thematic transition animation plays (leveraging Framer Motion). For
example, for Nostalgia Trap, the screen might briefly fade to black with a pulsing heart icon before
revealing the new page – reinforcing the emotional theme. This is a “rift-jump” interaction that
makes entering each world feel deliberate and exciting. Under the hood, we’ll use Framer Motion’s
<AnimatePresence> and route transition hooks to animate page exits and entrances smoothly
(e.g. fading out the home content and fading in the world content with a slight delay for effect). The
goal is to make the user feel like they’ve stepped into a new environment while keeping navigation
feel seamless.
Exploring the World (Multi-Page Narrative): Inside a mix’s world, navigation may deepen. The user
is typically landed on the World’s intro page – for example, Disco Ascension’s intro presents a
briefing-style warning (“CLASSIFIED MATERIAL”) and the mix title in dramatic fashion. The user can
scroll to read narrative content that sets the scene (e.g. storyline paragraphs, imagery, quotes). In
some cases, an introductory overlay might appear: Nostalgia Trap, for instance, could first display a
full-screen prompt “Before You Enter...” asking the user to recall an emotional memory, then a button
“I’m Ready to Remember” which, when clicked, reveals the page content. Such an overlay acts as an
immersive prompt to prime the listener’s mindset. Once in the world, the user can navigate to sub-
sections/pages of that world: for example, a sticky sub-nav or simply scrolling could reveal sections
like “Story”, “Tracklist”, “Gallery” or “Blog”. Each of these could be separate pages or anchored
sections with unique content but consistent thematic styling. The navigation within a world will use
thematic icons and labels (e.g., a small UFO icon for Disco Ascension’s conspiracy blog, a broken heart
icon for Nostalgia Trap’s personal anecdotes section, etc.), reinforcing that each world has its own
identity.
Media Playback and Interaction: A core part of each world is listening to the DJ mix itself. The user
will encounter a built-in audio player (likely an embedded SoundCloud or Mixcloud player) on the
intro page or a dedicated “Listen” page. This embedded player will allow playback without leaving
the site – e.g. a SoundCloud widget showing the waveform and play controls inline . The design
ensures this embed feels native: perhaps skinned with a custom color scheme matching the world,
or framed by narrative context (“Recovered from the Groove Singularity incident” might caption the
Disco Ascension player, per its lore). The user can play the mix and continue reading content; if they
navigate to other pages of the world, the audio could persist (either by using a global player
component or by relying on SoundCloud’s persistent play if the embed is not unloaded). Additionally,
interactive visuals might respond to the music: for later phases, we plan that as music plays,
