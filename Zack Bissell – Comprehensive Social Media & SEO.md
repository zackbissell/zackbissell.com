Zack Bissell – Comprehensive Social Media & SEO  
Audit (2025)  
Profile Inventory & Current Presence  
Artist & Streaming Platforms: Zack Bissell’s music is now distributed widely across major DSPs. Following  
the release of his single “Meridian” in March 2025, official artist profiles were generated on Spotify, Apple  
Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, Pandora, SoundCloud, Audiomack, JioSaavn, and  
more 1 2  
. Notably, Spotify has an artist page (Artist ID: 3rRurYCTYjMNv1x54f6n7q) featuring “Meridian,”  
and Apple Music likewise has a profile (Apple ID: 1807350692\) for Zack 3  
. However, most of these  
profiles remain unclaimed or unoptimized. For example, Apple Music shows Zack’s profile as unclaimed/  
pending verification 3  
, and Spotify’s profile exists but has not yet been officially claimed via Spotify for  
Artists 4  
. This means Zack currently has minimal control over the content (bio, images) on these  
platforms. Tidal, Deezer, Amazon Music, Pandora and others similarly have auto-generated Zack Bissell  
pages due to the track delivery 5 6  
– all of which should be claimed through their respective artist  
portals to update bios, photos, and ensure Zack can access analytics. On SoundCloud, Zack operates an  
account under the handle @zackbissellmusic (recently updated to Brooklyn, NY) which currently hosts both  
his original track “Meridian” and multiple DJ mixes 7 8  
. The SoundCloud profile has a modest \~89  
follower count (versus 92 following) as of its last index 9  
, indicating a small but existing audience from  
earlier activity (likely dating back to his Sacramento band days given the older bio snippet). Mixcloud is  
another key platform for Zack: he has uploaded \~18 mixes and built a following of \~150+ followers there.  
Mixcloud is where Zack has seen some success, with his mixes charting in niche categories (e.g. \#1 on  
Global Dance-Punk for “nostalgia trap, reality slap” mix 10 11  
). An Official Artist Channel on YouTube is  
in progress – currently, Zack’s YouTube presence includes a personal channel (with a custom URL  
@ZackBissell ) hosting a few videos (e.g. a House Work: Elevation short film, live set clips, and Bigo Live  
stream highlights 12  
). This channel is not yet merged with his auto-generated “Zack Bissell – Topic” channel,  
so it lacks the official music note badge (gaining an Official Artist Channel status via YouTube Music is an  
action item). Bandcamp and Beatport/Traxsource profiles are notably absent – since Meridian was not  
delivered to Beatport/Traxsource 13  
, Zack currently has no presence on those DJ-centric stores.  
Establishing a label page on Bandcamp (for Lab Obsidian) and prepping for Beatport in future releases is  
recommended.  
Social Media Platforms: Zack maintains a presence on all major social channels, though with varying levels  
of activity and impact:  
•  
Instagram (@zack.bissell): This is Zack’s most established social account, serving as his primary  
public persona. He has over 1.4K followers on Instagram 14  
and a hefty archive of \~963 posts,  
indicating years of content. His IG bio positions him clearly: “Immersive house DJ sets with precision,  
storytelling & unexpected moments that redefine the dancefloor.” It’s a strong, on-brand statement  
consistent with his “storytelling DJ & sonic architect” identity. Engagement on Instagram appears  
moderate – he’s built a community but it hasn’t broken out of a modest scale yet. Notably, Zack  
follows \~2.8K accounts 15  
, a number nearly double his follower count, which suggests an imbalance  
1•  
•  
in audience vs. followings. This could indicate past follow-back tactics or simply a highly networked  
personal account, but from a branding perspective it means his influence on IG hasn’t outgrown  
his personal network. Content-wise, he posts a mix of event promos, DJ set photos/videos, and  
narrative captions. For instance, he shared promotional imagery for his “Disco Ascension” set at  
Broken Land bar 16 17  
, as well as personal moments (e.g. thanking friends for coming to shows ).  
There’s evidence of creative storytelling in captions, but there may be gaps in leveraging newer IG  
features (e.g. Reels, collaborative posts) – most posts indexed are photos with descriptive captions.  
Trend: Zack’s IG was historically very active (hundreds of posts), but we should check if he has  
dropped off in posting frequency recently. If his last posts were weeks or months ago and mainly event  
flyers, that’s a gap; however, given recent event activity (Broken Land shows in mid-2025), he does  
still post updates (one caption even joked about posting a picture two weeks late 16  
). Opportunity:  
Instagram remains a key platform for the music community, and Zack has a decent foundation here.  
To grow beyond the \~1.5k follower plateau, he should pivot to more Reels (short performance  
clips, crowd reaction videos), behind-the-scenes Story content, and possibly use the new  
Broadcast Channel feature (which he mentions – “join my Broadcast Channel, Zack Bissell: On Deck” –  
on his bio.site 18  
). These can boost engagement and reach, as the algorithm now favors Reels and  
direct audience interaction. Also, cleaning up the following/follower ratio (e.g. auditing non-mutual  
follows or using a more curated following list) could subtly improve external perception (making his  
account look more like an artist account than a personal one).  
TikTok (@zack.bissell): Zack’s TikTok presence is relatively new and limited. He has about 209  
followers and \~2,377 total likes on TikTok 19  
– indicating a small audience but some content has  
resonated beyond his follower count. Indeed, a few of his TikTok videos garnered 1.5K+ likes each  
and likely tens of thousands of views, far exceeding his follower base 20 21  
. Notably, Zack  
leveraged TikTok’s viral potential with culturally relevant posts: for example, he posted a clip from the  
Solid Pink Disco (Pride NYC 2023\) event featuring drag icons Katya & Trixie Mattel, using trending  
audio (“Padam Padam”) and tags 20 21  
. This video received \~1.5K likes, showing that tapping into  
popular culture (LGBTQ+ nightlife in this case) can amplify his reach. Another TikTok promoted the  
release of a mix (“Out now\! \#newyork \#housemusic \#brooklyn \#dj \#mix”) 22  
, and one playful post  
used an \#AIMagic filter (“Look, it’s me with hair”) 23  
– suggesting he’s experimenting with both  
promo and personality-driven content. Trend: Zack’s TikTok content is sporadic but shows signs of  
virality when he hits the right note (Pride event clip). He hasn’t yet built a consistent presence –  
only a handful of videos, some posted recently (one clip was noted as “1w ago” in search results) –  
but the platform’s algorithm has given him bursts of exposure. Gap: The follower count (209) is low,  
meaning TikTok isn’t yet driving a fan community for him; people may see his videos on their FYP  
and not follow. Also, if he’s not posting regularly, momentum is lost. Opportunity: With short-form  
video dominating discovery, TikTok is a prime channel for Zack to revive. He should capitalize on his  
storytelling angle in 15–60 second clips – e.g., mini storytelling about the concept behind a mix,  
quick DJ trick tutorials, or high-energy crowd moments from his weekly gigs. Consistency (at least a  
few posts per week) could convert viral viewers into followers. Cross-posting these videos as Reels  
on Instagram and as YouTube Shorts will also maximize their impact. In summary, TikTok is an  
underdeveloped asset where Zack has already seen sparks of success – doubling down here could  
significantly boost his reach among younger, music-hungry audiences.  
Twitter (X @ZackBissell): Zack launched a Twitter (now X) account for his DJ persona, but it has  
minimal traction to date. The X profile bio captures his humor and multi-faceted background: “Just  
your average thirty-something professional stage actor/singer/musician/high-profile event producer  
2•  
•  
turned DJ/music producer. Cash me charting on Mixcloud.” 24  
. This tongue-in-cheek tone (“cash me  
\[on\] Mixcloud”) is on-brand with his irreverent style, but the platform itself is not a major source of  
audience engagement for him. Followers: The follower count on X isn’t explicitly known from  
available data (likely in the low hundreds or less, given the account’s newness in late 2024). We do  
know Zack had a historic personal Twitter under another handle (@gyu\_doh) for his band/earlier life  
in Sacramento, but his official DJ account @ZackBissell is essentially starting from scratch. Activity:  
He has tweeted about his projects – e.g., announcing the Disco Ascension mix release on Dec 12, 2024  
25  
. However, overall activity seems low (no evidence of daily/weekly tweeting or community  
interaction). Gaps: Twitter/X is notoriously hard to grow without active engagement or viral content,  
especially in 2025 when many in the music community have either reduced usage or moved to  
alternatives like Threads. Zack’s witty bio aside, there’s little to suggest a strong strategy or audience  
here. Recommendation: Treat X as a secondary outlet – it’s useful for networking and the occasional  
announcement, but not critical for Zack’s core fanbase which lives on more visual platforms. If Zack  
chooses to revive it, a strategy could be repurposing content (e.g., posting short video clips or gig  
announcements simultaneously on X) and interacting with relevant music threads or local nightlife  
conversations to gain visibility. Otherwise, it may be wise to focus efforts elsewhere (and possibly  
ensure his handle points people to his other links). At minimum, the account should be kept updated  
with current links and perhaps an occasional post to show it’s active for anyone who searches for  
him there.  
Threads (@zack.bissell on Threads): Zack jumped on Meta’s Threads (the Twitter-like platform  
linked to Instagram) when it launched – his Threads profile shows 322 followers already 26  
, likely  
auto-populated from his IG connections. However, he has 0 Threads posts (essentially no content) as  
of now 26  
. In his Threads bio, he describes himself as “Brooklyn based DJ, Producer, Musician, Actor;  
Gglbtch Extraordinaire. ZackBissell.com for tunes.” – a slightly more irreverent/personal tone than  
Instagram (the “Gglbtch Extraordinaire” tagline shows some inside humor). This indicates he  
intended Threads to be a more casual, community space. Gaps: By not posting at all on Threads,  
Zack is missing an opportunity to engage an audience that is already following him (those 322 folks  
are essentially low-hanging fruit who opted to connect). Many creators saw initial high follower  
counts on Threads due to Instagram linkage, but then the novelty wore off. If Threads still has active  
user attention in late 2025, Zack should consider leveraging it: for quick gig updates, one-liner  
stories from the DJ booth, or personal insights that don’t fit Instagram’s polished feed. The tone can  
be informal and story-like, which actually suits his narrative brand. If he remains inactive, it’s not a  
huge loss (Threads usage has been volatile), but given he effortlessly has a few hundred followers  
there, a little activity could go a long way. At the very least, ensuring his Threads bio and link are  
up-to-date (they are, pointing to his website) and occasionally mirroring content from Twitter/IG  
(since Threads is essentially IG’s text outlet) would keep this channel warm.  
Facebook: Zack has a Facebook presence in the form of a public artist page (“Zack Bissell”), but it  
is very small-scale. The page has on the order of \~39 likes/followers only 27  
– indicating that  
Facebook is not a focus or that it was created recently and not promoted. It appears Zack used the  
page primarily for a few announcements. For instance, he posted about his distribution partnership  
and upcoming releases, writing “This partnership opens the door to releasing my music on over 280  
platforms...” on Facebook 27  
(likely referring to signing with VerseOne to distribute Meridian on all  
major services). That post suggests the page was used as a public announcement channel when he  
had big news. Gaps: With under 50 followers, anything posted on the FB page has minimal organic  
reach. There’s also potential confusion if Zack’s personal profile is private or if fans try to friend  
3•  
•  
request him; an official page is good to have, but it’s currently not doing much work. Trends: Overall,  
DJs and artists of Zack’s level find limited growth on Facebook in 2025 (especially younger club  
audiences are more on IG/TikTok). Zack’s page is effectively stagnant. Recommendation: Given the  
low upside, Zack doesn’t need to invest heavily in Facebook content. However, since the page exists,  
he should keep it consistent and updated as a basic info hub – i.e., update the profile picture,  
banner, “About” section with his latest bio, and mirror key announcements (release drops, major gig  
flyers) so that anyone who stumbles on it sees current info. Also, integrating Facebook with  
Instagram (via Meta’s Creator Studio or Business Suite) would allow him to automatically repost his  
Instagram content to Facebook. This way, his FB page stays active without separate effort. In short,  
maintain it as a low-effort broadcast channel for those few who use it, but don’t prioritize it for  
growth.  
YouTube: As mentioned earlier, Zack’s YouTube channel is in nascent stages. He has a channel  
(likely with a handle like @ZackBissell or a channel ID) where he’s uploaded a handful of videos,  
including creative projects like “House Work: Elevation – The Film” (a cinematic visual  
accompaniment to his mix) and possibly recordings of live sets (e.g., a clip titled “Disco Ascension: A  
Disco House Paradox – Live” with \~90 views 28  
). The content also includes at least one Bigo Live  
streaming clip he saved to YouTube 12  
. Audience: The subscriber count isn’t disclosed in our data,  
but given view counts (tens of views on some uploads), it’s safe to assume a very small subscriber  
base (likely \<100) at present. Gap: YouTube is the world’s second-largest search engine and a crucial  
platform for music discovery (especially for DJ sets, festival recordings, etc.), yet Zack’s presence here  
is minimal. Without an Official Artist Channel, his music content is split: Meridian lives on a topic  
channel and his personal uploads don’t link to that. Opportunity: There’s a real chance to improve  
SEO and discovery by expanding on YouTube. Zack should consider uploading more content – even if  
not full DJ sets (which can get taken down for copyright), he can post teasers, recaps, or original  
material. For example, short “story behind the mix” videos, or edited 10-minute highlights of his live  
sets with cleared music, could attract viewers. Additionally, creating playlists on his channel  
(featuring his own releases, his mixes hosted on other channels, etc.) will make his channel a one-  
stop destination. Once he has a couple official releases out, he should work with his distributor to  
merge his channel into an Official Artist Channel, so that subscribers to his personal channel get  
the new releases and his music videos under one roof 5  
. In terms of SEO, YouTube videos can rank  
on Google for relevant searches (for instance, someone searching “Zack Bissell DJ set” or even  
generic terms like “Brooklyn house mix live” could stumble on his content if properly titled). Right  
now that opportunity is largely untapped – his videos have generic titles and low reach. With better  
titles, tags, and regular uploads, YouTube could become both a content showcase and an SEO  
booster for Zack.  
Resident Advisor (RA): Zack has an artist profile on Resident Advisor (ra.co) which consolidates  
his event history and news mentions. On RA, he’s listed as a DJ based in NYC, with links out to all his  
socials and website 29  
. He has been proactive in populating RA: a brief biography is present (“Zack  
Bissell crafts DJ sets as immersive storyscapes…” as seen in RA’s bio snippet) 30  
, and importantly, his  
past and upcoming events are tracked. For example, RA shows events like Warehouse Confessional  
(May 3, 2025), Meridian Sessions at Broken Land (Apr 5, 2025), Subtext at Broken Land etc. This indicates  
Zack (or promoters) have been listing his gigs on RA, which is great for visibility among the house/  
29  
techno community. Followers on RA: Currently only 2 RA users “follow” Zack’s RA profile,  
which is very low. RA followings are generally low unless the artist is well-known, but encouraging  
fans to follow him on RA (for event alerts) could be beneficial as he expands. Audit: RA is a strong  
4•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
platform for credibility – Zack has even been featured in RA news or at least the RA feed (his EPK  
cites “Featured by Resident Advisor” as an achievement 31  
, and there’s a press quote “Not just a DJ,  
but an experience.” attributed to RA 32  
). We should verify if RA published an article or if that quote  
is from an event listing, but in any case Zack’s association with RA is a positive. Recommendation:  
Continue leveraging RA fully. Ensure every gig is created as an event on RA (so that anyone searching  
RA or looking at local event listings sees Zack’s name frequently). Also, consider contributing charts  
or mixes to RA if possible (they sometimes accept DJ charts or mix series – a chart of Zack’s top 10  
tracks of the month, for instance, could get posted and drive profile views). The RA profile should  
remain updated with a current bio and links (which it is). Given RA’s high SEO authority, Zack’s RA  
page often appears on the first page of Google results for his name 33  
– it’s essentially an online  
resume for the underground scene. Keeping that sharp and active is key.  
Bandsintown: Zack does have a Bandsintown artist page, likely auto-generated when he had a show  
in Glens Falls (Downtown Social on Mar 06, 2025\) 34  
. Bandsintown shows his upcoming/past events  
and allows fans to track him for concert alerts. It appears one or more of his shows were listed,  
meaning fans could RSVP or buy tickets through Bandsintown. However, similar to RA, his follower  
count on Bandsintown is minimal (the search snippet doesn’t show followers; typically new artists  
might have 0-1 trackers until they promote it). Recommendation: If Zack is actively gigging, he  
should claim his Bandsintown profile (if not already) and use it to list all shows. The benefit is that it  
plugs into Facebook and other sites for event discovery. He can embed a Bandsintown widget on his  
site or bio page so fans can see tour dates. Currently, this is a smaller priority than RA (Bandsintown  
skews more toward live band audiences vs. DJ/club audiences), but since the infrastructure is there,  
there’s no harm in maintaining it for the broader public who use it to find local events.  
Other Platforms: Zack has experimented or has a minor presence on a few other platforms:  
Mixcloud Select/Subscriptions: On Mixcloud, Zack has set up a Select subscription (Mixcloud’s fan  
subscription feature) for exclusive content 35  
. This is forward-thinking – it allows super-fans to  
subscribe for a fee to get perks like offline listening or bonus mixes. However, to make use of it, Zack  
needs a critical mass of fans. With \~150 Mixcloud followers, conversion to paid subscribers might be  
very low right now (perhaps only a couple of subscribers, if any). Opportunity: Keep the Select  
option available, but focus on growing the free audience first by consistently uploading quality mixes  
and promoting them. Charting on Mixcloud (as he has done) is excellent for visibility; interacting with  
commenters and other DJs there can slowly build his following.  
Audiomack: Meridian was delivered to Audiomack (an urban/indie music streaming site) and a  
profile likely exists, though Zack hasn’t actively claimed or used it yet 36 37  
. Given Audiomack’s  
focus (hip-hop, mixtapes, etc.), it’s not a priority unless Zack wants to push his original productions  
there.  
Audius: Not to be confused with Audiomack, Audius is a web3 music platform. Zack does not appear  
to have an Audius profile yet (no public record of one). If he’s interested in the crypto music space,  
claiming his name there and maybe uploading a track or two could be a future consideration, but it’s  
optional.  
Boiler Room: While Boiler Room was mentioned, Zack has not performed a Boiler Room set (and  
thus has no profile or video on their channel). Attaining a Boiler Room feature would be a huge  
boost, but that’s an aspiration item. For now, no presence there – which is normal for an emerging  
DJ.  
5•  
Gigmit / ReverbNation / LinkedIn: These are peripheral, but for completeness: a Gigmit profile  
snippet was found (a European booking platform) with a short bio 38  
, likely something Zack or a  
promoter made; it’s not major for his current strategy. A ReverbNation page exists (perhaps auto-  
created, listing songs/videos) but Zack isn’t active there – ReverbNation is quite outdated for  
electronic artists. Zack’s LinkedIn profile is active in a professional capacity (label director of Lab  
Obsidian) 39  
, which is fine for networking but not relevant to fan outreach. These don’t need focus  
in a social/SEO plan, but they round out the fact that Zack’s name is starting to appear across the  
web in various contexts.  
Unified Link Directory: Below is a structured directory of Zack Bissell’s key online profiles, content pages,

Social Media Audit – Gaps, Trends & Recommendations  
Now we dive into a brutally honest audit of Zack’s social media presence: what’s working, what isn’t, and  
where he should focus or pivot. Zack’s brand is that of a “storytelling DJ” who merges narrative and music –  
an exciting USP (unique selling proposition) that should reflect across his socials. The reality, however,  
shows inconsistencies and missed opportunities in how that story is told on each platform:  
•  
•  
•  
Instagram: Historically Zack’s main outlet, Instagram shows consistency in branding but possibly  
stagnation in growth. On the plus side, his identity as a Brooklyn-based “immersive house DJ” is clear  
and he regularly posts about gigs and mix releases. His feed conveys a mix of event flyers, behind-  
the-decks shots, and thematic art (e.g., stylized graphics for his mixes). However, engagement per  
post seems limited (likely on the order of a few dozen likes/comments given his follower count). One  
issue is that much of his content has been static images and text-centric storytelling in captions.  
Trend shift: Instagram in 2024–2025 heavily favors Reels (short videos) – DJs who post 30-second  
hype videos of their crowd or creative mashups tend to reach beyond their followers. Zack has not  
fully capitalized on this. Additionally, while he posts frequently around events, there might be dry  
spells in between major shows or releases where his IG goes quiet. This inconsistency can hurt the  
algorithm’s treatment of his content. Another gap: Zack’s follower count relative to his post count  
(1.4k followers for \~960 posts) suggests that despite a lot of content over time, he hasn’t converted  
many new fans lately – possibly the same circle of supporters engages with most posts.  
Recommendation: Radically change the IG content strategy to spark growth. For example:  
Start creating Reels for each major gig or mix drop – even a 15-second montage of crowd dancing  
at Broken Land, with a caption “\#Brooklyn vibe last night 📽 ” can attract local music fans via  
hashtags.  
Do mini-story series in IG Stories or Carousel posts. Zack’s strength is storytelling, so use that: a 5-  
frame carousel where each slide has a sentence from a “story” of the night, ending with a call to  
action to listen to the full mix. This both engages and advertises his content in a novel way.  
7•  
•  
•  
Engage the community: e.g., pose questions or polls in Stories (“What’s a song that always triggers  
nostalgia for you?” before dropping his Nostalgia Trap mix link). This can generate interaction and  
make followers feel involved.  
Optimize profile: his link in bio currently goes to either his .bio site or website – that’s good (one  
hub). He might consider using Instagram’s new features like the broadcast channel (which he  
already opened) more actively for direct announcements or even drop exclusive discount codes for  
shows to channel members, etc.  
Finally, analytics: Check IG insights to see when his followers are online, which posts did best, and  
double down on those types. For instance, if a candid DJ booth photo with a heartfelt caption  
performed better than a generic flyer, prioritize that kind of content.  
In summary: Instagram isn’t “dead” for Zack, but it needs a jolt of video content and interactive storytelling  
to break out of its current plateau. The pieces (solid branding, decent base following) are there; execution  
needs to align with 2025’s content trends.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
TikTok: Zack’s TikTok is a classic case of “high potential, low utilization.” The few videos he’s posted  
demonstrate that people are interested in his content when it intersects with trending culture.  
For example, the Pride event clip with drag queens tapped into multiple algorithms (LGBTQ, Pride,  
popular meme song) and rewarded him with far more views than his follower count would predict.  
However, Zack has only a handful of posts – meaning he’s effectively a one-hit wonder on TikTok at  
the moment. Gap: No consistent content means no sustained growth. TikTok’s algorithm rewards  
regular posting; creators who post even 1-2 times daily see much stronger follower gains. Zack  
doesn’t need to spam low-quality content, but he does have a lot he could share:  
He DJs weekly – why not have someone film 15 seconds of every set (even on an iPhone) whenever  
there’s a big crowd reaction or he drops a classic track? Those clips, with captions like “Brooklyn went  
OFF when I dropped this 90s classic at 4:45am \#housemusic”, could resonate.  
Use TikTok to tease story concepts: e.g., a video of him in his studio with text on screen: “I’m  
building a DJ mix that imagines a time-traveling disco… (sound crazy? here’s how it sounds) \[cut to a  
snippet\]”. This kind of content both intrigues and advertises his Mixcloud link for the full thing.  
Duet or stitch relevant content: For instance, if someone posts “What’s the most creative DJ set  
you’ve seen?”, Zack can stitch that with a quick “I try to make every set a story – last week I did one  
about a ‘groove singularity’…”. This inserts him into TikTok’s wider conversations and shows  
personality.  
Also, consider the music challenge side: TikTok frequently has trending challenges or remix trends.  
If any align with his style (e.g., a trend using a disco track or a remix challenge of a popular song),  
Zack could jump in to showcase his take – this can expose him to non-followers massively.  
In short, TikTok could be a game-changer for Zack if used right. It’s one of the few platforms where an  
unknown DJ can amass a following quickly through smart content. The fact that he already hit 1.5k likes on  
a video means the algorithm can favor him. The brutal truth: he needs to show up consistently. Not  
posting \= not existing on TikTok. A tentative goal could be 2-3 TikToks per week to start, analyzing which  
ones get traction, and iterating. With that, getting from 200 to 1k+ followers in a few months is feasible,  
which will also drive listeners to his music (especially if every viral video subtly plugs his website or mixes).  
•  
Twitter (X): Zack’s effort on X is minimal, and realistically, the return might also be minimal. The  
platform has changed, and for music artists without an existing Twitter fanbase, it’s hard to justify  
heavy focus. The audit here is straightforward: Zack’s X is not driving fan engagement or growth.  
His few tweets are more like public diary entries or witty remarks (which do contribute to his persona  
8•  
•  
– a bit of humor, a bit of self-awareness about being new in the DJ game). But there’s no evidence of  
a community or conversation around his tweets. For example, his announcement of Disco Ascension  
in Dec 2024 likely got little traction (we didn’t see any mention of likes/RTs). Also, his follower count is  
probably very low (maybe dozens). If Zack enjoys using X to follow music news or interact with a  
handful of industry folks, it’s fine to maintain. But from a strategic standpoint, X is the lowest  
priority social platform for him. The opportunity cost of crafting Twitter content could be better  
spent on a TikTok video or IG reel that will reach far more people. Additionally, X’s user base skews  
towards news, tech, and to some extent big-room EDM stars – a niche storytelling house DJ from  
Brooklyn isn’t naturally discoverable there.  
One specific use for X: networking with other artists or labels. If Zack uses it to reply to, say, a local  
festival’s lineup announcement (“Would love to play this one day\!”) or to congratulate a fellow DJ on a  
release, those interactions can slowly build industry visibility. But that’s a slow burn.  
Also, any important announcements he posts on IG (like a new mix out) can be copy-pasted to X just  
to have a footprint. Think of it as a press wire – low engagement expected, but it’s there for  
completeness.  
Bottom line: No need to pivot resources into X. Keep it on life-support (updated bio, occasional posts to  
show he’s alive on there) and focus elsewhere.  
•  
•  
•  
Threads: The rise of Threads gave many creators a fresh start in a more positive, Instagram-linked  
environment. Zack’s early adoption got him 300+ followers without trying, which is a boon. The  
glaring gap is the lack of content (0 posts), which means those followers have zero engagement  
with him so far. If Threads continues to develop as a platform, Zack should decide whether to  
incorporate it into his strategy. The nice thing about Threads is the low-pressure, conversational  
style – it’s an arena where Zack could share the witty, off-the-cuff thoughts he might normally share  
in a private circle. For example, he could thread about the story behind a mix while linking to it:  
“Thread: 🎧 The story of how a broken hard drive and an old disco record inspired my latest DJ mix…  
(1/5)”. This kind of storytelling in text form can deepen his narrative brand and reward those IG  
followers who connected with him on Threads.  
If he finds it too much to manage another channel, he could simply repurpose content: e.g., take a  
tweet or an IG caption and post it on Threads, perhaps adding a bit more context or an emoji or two.  
Given that he already has some audience on Threads, it’s an easy win to at least occasionally post  
there. It keeps those followers reminded of him. Even a casual “Heading to Broken Land for my set,  
let’s get immersive ” on a Saturday night could get some interaction.  
Since Threads is still evolving (by 2025 it might have better search, hashtags, or integration), being  
moderately active could yield benefits later on (e.g., if Threads launches a discovery page for local topics or  
music, active users might be highlighted). It’s not critical, but it’s a low-effort, potential-upside situation. So  
the audit verdict: Zack should either start using Threads lightly or at least acknowledge those  
followers with a first post, or else those 322 people are essentially a wasted segment of his fanbase.  
•  
Facebook: Brutal truth – Zack’s Facebook page is almost a non-entity in terms of reach. With 39  
followers, posts there are likely seen by 5-10 people if that (unless shared). Additionally, Facebook’s  
demographic skew is older; the people who liked his page might be personal friends or a few  
supporters from an older generation. Trend: Many artists, unless they pay for ads, see low  
engagement on Facebook in recent years. Zack is no exception. The only reason to keep Facebook in  
the loop is for completeness and SEO (Facebook pages are indexed on Google). It’s also useful if he  
9•  
•  
ever decides to run targeted ads (e.g., to promote a local show or his new track, a FB page is needed  
for that).  
Strategy moving forward: Keep the page up to date with the major news (don’t worry about day-to-  
day posting). Ensure the profile picture and cover image match his current branding (maybe use the  
same images as his website for consistency). Post when there’s a new Mixcloud upload or a big  
event; even if few see it, someone Googling him might click the Facebook link and see that, for  
example, “Meridian is out now on all platforms” – which is good.  
Pivot if necessary: If down the line Zack’s target audience broadens (say he starts doing more  
mainstream festival gigs or corporate events where a broader public might look him up), then  
Facebook could regain importance. In that case, he might need to invest in content there and  
possibly advertising. But for now, it’s simply a placeholder with occasional updates.  
So, the brutally honest take: Facebook is not worth significant effort at this stage, but don’t delete it. It’s a  
free business card on the web – keep it, polish it minimally, but allocate your creative time to platforms that  
give better ROI (Instagram, TikTok, etc.).

YouTube: The audit of Zack’s YouTube content reveals a lot of untapped potential and a need for  
strategic direction. His current uploads – the House Work: Elevation film, some live set recordings,  
maybe a promo or two – are great conceptually (they align with his immersive storytelling brand).  
However, they aren’t reaching many people, likely due to lack of consistency, lack of promotion, and  
YouTube’s algorithm not having enough data to favor his channel yet. In 2025, YouTube can be  
leveraged in a few ways by a DJ like Zack:  
Long-form content for die-hards: e.g., full DJ sets or themed mixes with cool visuals. (The risk here  
is copyright, but some DJs post mixes with either minor edits or accept demonetization; if Zack isn’t  
monetizing yet, the main concern is just takedowns. Alternatively, he can split mixes into parts or  
talk over them to classify as “commentary”). Since Zack already made a 37-minute “Disco Ascension  
Live” video 28  
and a full film, he has the capability.  
Shorts for discovery: YouTube Shorts (under 60s vertical videos) might actually be a duplicate effort  
of TikTok, but posting those same viral TikToks as Shorts could net him additional exposure. Shorts  
can lead users to his channel and possibly convert to subscribers who will check out his longer  
videos.  
Educational or behind-the-scenes: Many artists grow on YouTube by sharing knowledge or  
personality. Zack could do a series like “Storytime with a DJ” where in 5 minutes he recounts a wild  
club night (no music needed, just engaging storytelling – fitting for his persona). Or a tutorial of how  
he prepares an immersive set. These might attract aspiring DJs or the musically curious, expanding  
his reach beyond just people who already know him.  
Current gap: He hasn’t established a regular posting schedule or format, so the algorithm isn’t sure who to  
show his content to. The subscriber count is low, so initial views are low, making it hard to snowball.  
Recommendation: Treat YouTube as both an archive and a marketing channel. Every significant piece of  
content he creates (audio or visual) should have some presence on YouTube. For example, even if Mixcloud  
is the main home for an audio mix, he can upload a “visualizer” of the mix to YouTube (with perhaps some  
cool waveform or slideshow of event clips) and SEO-optimize the title (“Zack Bissell – Nostalgia Trap  
(Emotional House DJ Set) \[2024\]”). This way, people searching on YouTube for house mixes might find it. He  
should also fill out video descriptions with relevant keywords (Brooklyn DJ, house mix, disco house, etc.) and  
links to his other profiles. Over time, as he adds more content, his channel will start to appear in related  
video suggestions.  
10Also important: Official Artist Channel (OAC) integration. As soon as possible, Zack (through VerseOne or  
directly) should request YouTube to merge his channels and give him the OAC badge 5  
. This will unify  
content and subscribers – for instance, “Meridian” would show up on his main channel under a Music tab,  
and his channel will get the music note icon. This not only looks professional but also boosts the channel’s  
authority in YouTube’s eyes. It may even pull together his topic channel’s subscribers (if any) into his base.  
Trend: YouTube is increasingly a place where electronic music fans listen to DJ sets (just as much as  
SoundCloud). Many use YouTube’s auto-generated mixes or find Boiler Room sets, etc. While Zack doesn’t  
have those big-brand sets yet, he can still position his content to be found. The SEO aspect is key: use  
descriptive titles and thumbnails. Right now, a video titled “Disco Ascension Live” with no context might not  
grab attention – adding a bit like “Disco Ascension: Live at Broken Land (Storytelling House Set)” could catch  
48  
eyes .  
Brutal truth: At present, Zack’s YouTube is not living up to its potential and is not contributing much to his  
discoverability. It’s largely a repository that only people who already know him might visit. He should pivot  
to make it a discovery platform: more content (even repurposed content), more keyword optimization, and  
leverage Shorts. It may not explode overnight, but it sets foundations. And given YouTube search results  
already show his channel in Google 49  
, improving it will improve what people see when they search his  
name (e.g., seeing a professional channel with a cohesive set of videos rather than a nearly empty one).  
•  
•  
•  
Mixcloud & SoundCloud: These two are grouped because they form the core of Zack’s content output  
(his mixes and music) and have overlapping issues. Mixcloud has been Zack’s haven for full DJ mixes  
due to its legal-friendly platform. He’s had success here: multiple mixes uploaded (18), chart  
placements, and a small community of 150 followers who likely are his most dedicated listeners. He  
also monetized via Select which is forward-thinking. SoundCloud, on the other hand, is more of a  
legacy platform for him – originally used during his Sacramento days (with band references in his old  
bio) and now repurposed to host “Meridian” and some mixes. It has \~89 followers and likely some  
casual listeners who stumble upon his tracks 9  
. The gap: Maintaining two platforms with the same  
content can split plays and attention. Also, SoundCloud runs the risk of content takedowns (if his  
mixes include copyrighted tracks, they might get flagged eventually). So far, it appears his mixes  
from 2024 are still up, meaning either SoundCloud hasn’t flagged them or he’s flying under the radar.  
Strategy analysis:  
Mixcloud clearly aligns better with his needs (unlimited mix length, charts, subscription option). It is  
where he should drive his fans for mix listening. In fact, his website and bio links emphasize  
35  
Mixcloud for “exclusive content” .  
SoundCloud is still important for reach – many general music fans search SoundCloud and might  
find him. Also, SoundCloud allows downloads (if he enables) which some fans appreciate. And since  
he does have original music (Meridian), SoundCloud acts as a home for those where people expect  
to find tracks.  
Recommendation/Pivot: Use SoundCloud primarily for original productions, remixes, or shorter  
promotional mixes, and use Mixcloud for the full-length storytelling DJ sets. This way, he’s not doubling  
effort and each platform has a clear role. For example, he could post a 30-minute “teaser cut” of Nostalgia  
Trap on SoundCloud (which might avoid copyright strikes if shorter and can act as an appetiser) with a note  
“Hear the full 1-hour journey on Mixcloud \-\> \[link\].” Meanwhile, the full version sits on Mixcloud safely  
gathering plays and comments. For original tracks like “Meridian” or future releases, definitely put them on  
SoundCloud (that’s where listeners and even A\&R folks often scout new artists). He should also tag  
11everything thoroughly (e.g., tag genres: “House, Disco, Indie Dance” etc., and use descriptions to tell the  
story of the mix – which he’s good at, as seen in his site copy).  
Also, engage more on both platforms: follow other artists, repost tracks he likes, comment on others’ mixes  
– this kind of community interaction can bring some attention back to his profile (particularly on  
SoundCloud which still has active user engagement in niches).  
Trends: Mixcloud has a smaller user base than SoundCloud but very devoted, especially for radio shows and  
DJ sets. Zack’s charting indicates he can climb ranks in niche genres – he should continue to leverage that by  
picking appropriate tags for his mixes (as he did with “dance-punk”, “indie dance” etc.). Each time he charts,  
it increases his visibility on the platform (people browsing charts see his name). SoundCloud’s trend is more  
towards original music and remixes; fewer people go there for hour-long mixes now. So Zack focusing each  
platform on what it does best is both time-saving and efficient for audience growth.  
Brutal take: Right now, Zack’s presence on these audio platforms is decent but could be sharper. The slight  
branding confusion (two places for mixes) and lack of aggressive promotion means he’s not maximizing  
plays. By consolidating effort (and perhaps gently migrating SoundCloud followers to Mixcloud via  
announcements), he can build one strong funnel instead of two middling ones.

Resident Advisor / Events: While not a “social media” in the traditional sense, RA and live event  
listings deserve mention in terms of Zack’s engagement with the scene. The audit finds that Zack has  
been active in performing live (multiple events in early 2025), but where’s the content from those  
events? Social media thrives on IRL to URL conversion – meaning, taking the live experience and  
broadcasting it online. Zack should ensure that for every significant event, he’s creating content to  
share:  
Live photos, short clips, or even post-event reflections (a Thread about “last night’s warehouse party  
felt like stepping into 1994 for real…”).  
Encouraging attendees to tag him in their stories (building some grassroots promotion).  
Posting the RA event link in advance on his socials to drive RSVPs (he has done some of this on IG  
from what we see).  
There’s also an opportunity to engage with Bandsintown/RA followers by posting updates or comments.  
Bandsintown allows messaging to “Trackers” (if he had any) about new shows. RA allows adding mixes or  
media to his artist page – for example, linking a SoundCloud mix or YouTube video so it appears on RA  
profile. He should do that: RA profile can showcase a Mixcloud link or a recent press article; utilizing that  
feature can turn RA into a mini-EPK for promoters who come across him.  
Gaps: His RA followers count (2) shows he’s not actively converting party-goers into online followers on RA.  
At shows, maybe mention “follow me on RA or IG for updates” on the mic or visually. It’s a minor thing but  
building RA followers can help secure future bookings (promoters see an engaged RA profile).  
Also, consider diversifying event platforms: Are his events listed on local Facebook events or other sites  
like EDM Train? (Edmtrain covers NYC events – if he’s not listed there, he might want to submit any public  
shows; it’s another discovery avenue for event-goers.) The SEO of event listings means when someone  
searches his name \+ “tickets” or “events”, those pages come up (Spotify even had a ticket link via an  
integration 50  
). So making sure all events have an online footprint is key for SEO around his live  
performance aspect.  
12Summary of Gaps & Remedies: In plain terms, Zack’s social media presence is rich in content but  
lacking in optimization and consistency. He has the raw materials: a distinct persona, plenty of creative  
output, and a foot in all relevant platforms. The shortcomings are mainly in execution – e.g., not adapting  
content style to platform (too many static posts on a video-first IG; too few TikToks; no engagement on  
acquired followers in Threads), and not fully controlling his narrative on streaming platforms (unclaimed  
profiles with no bios). The trend is that whenever Zack leans into his unique strengths (story-driven content,  
tying music to narrative and culture), he gets positive feedback (Mixcloud charts, TikTok virality). Where he  
“drops off” is when he fails to consistently deliver that or goes quiet for stretches.  
Key recommendations to revive or pivot:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Embrace short-form video across the board – repackage the storytelling into reels, TikToks, and  
shorts frequently. This is the \#1 way to revive stagnating social metrics in 2025\.  
Schedule regular content: For example, commit to one mix drop or live set upload per month (so  
there’s always something to promote), with weekly smaller posts in between (a throwback clip, a  
“track of the week” he’s loving, etc.). A content calendar will prevent the feast-or-famine posting  
pattern.  
Cross-pollinate audiences: Use each platform to push to the others strategically. Tweet the TikTok  
video, put the TikTok on IG Stories, tell TikTok viewers to check IG for full photos, etc. Right now, each  
channel feels a bit siloed.  
Refresh visuals and branding periodically: His branding is strong (brutalist, high-contrast aesthetic,  
as per Lab Obsidian ethos 47  
). Make sure that’s reflected – e.g., update profile pictures/banners to a  
consistent image or logo across all socials. Little things like a fresh logo on his SoundCloud and  
YouTube can signal that he’s active and professional (the EPK/brand system likely has these assets).  
Engage with followers: Social media is two-way. Reply to comments, ask questions in captions,  
maybe do an IG Live Q\&A or TikTok Live DJ session. If fans feel a dialogue, they’re more likely to stick  
around and advocate for him.  
Monitor analytics: brutally, if some platform isn’t growing at all (say Twitter by end of year still has  
\<100 followers), consider if it’s worth maintaining or if it should just auto-post updates via a linked  
account. Conversely, if TikTok suddenly jumps to 1000 followers because of a trend, prioritize that  
with extra content.  
In conclusion, Zack’s social media could use a shot of adrenaline – largely through video content and  
interactive storytelling – to match the energy of his in-person performances. He has to show online  
why his sets are “unforgettable journeys” 51  
. The content and stories are within him; the task is to translate  
that consistently into platform-appropriate posts. By doing so, he can turn his relatively scattered online  
presence into a cohesive, engaging narrative that draws in new fans and keeps the old ones excited.  
SEO Analysis – Keywords, Discoverability & Opportunities  
In this section, we shift to SEO: how discoverable is Zack online, and how he can improve his visibility on  
search engines and within platform search results. Given that Zack is an emerging artist, a lot of his traffic  
will be branded searches (people who hear his name and search “Zack Bissell”). We need to ensure those  
searches yield a robust, positive first impression, and also identify any non-branded keywords where Zack  
could capture interest (e.g., genre-related searches, local DJ queries). Additionally, we consider SEO not just  
on Google, but on YouTube (second largest search engine) and even Spotify search.  
13Current Search Presence (Google): A Google search for “Zack Bissell” currently returns a mixed but  
improving set of results. Thanks to his efforts in distribution and press: \- His Spotify artist page is a top  
result 52 53 54  
. \- Instagram profile often shows up, as do SoundCloud and Facebook pages . \- His official  
website (zackbissell.com), with its SEO title “Innovative DJ | Immersive Mixes & Live Sets – Zack Bissell,” is  
indexed and appears in results 55  
. It might not be the very first hit yet (Spotify/IG might outrank due to  
their domain strength), but it’s on page one. \- Resident Advisor appears with his upcoming events and  
likely a snippet from his bio 56  
. \- There are also some odd results like a Twitter search or a random  
mention (e.g., an unrelated person or a very old tweet) 57  
, which indicates that Zack’s digital footprint is  
still filling out – the more authoritative content about him that goes online, the more those irrelevant  
entries will be pushed out.  
Overall, for branded search “Zack Bissell,” the results are okay but can be improved by focusing on: \- Getting  
Zack’s own site to rank at or near the top (likely with more backlinks and consistent updates). \- Possibly  
creating a Wikipedia or MusicBrainz entry to trigger a Knowledge Panel (though Wikipedia requires  
notability – might be a stretch right now unless more press comes). \- Ensuring all top results are ones he  
controls or that accurately reflect his image (right now they mostly do: Spotify, IG, SC, RA – all good; maybe  
the Facebook snippet could be better if it showed his tagline instead of a partial post).  
Keyword and Content Opportunities: Beyond people searching his name, how can Zack attract new  
eyeballs via search? Here are some angles: \- Genre and Scene Keywords: Zack is involved in house, disco,  
indie dance scenes in Brooklyn. People do search for things like “Best house DJs in Brooklyn” or “Brooklyn  
disco house set”. It’s niche, but Zack could capture some of that. For instance, if his website had a blog  
section where he writes short articles or even listicles (e.g., “5 Must-Hear Disco-Infused House Sets This  
Month” featuring one of his), those could rank for genre queries. Or simply optimizing his site’s copy with  
those keywords: his homepage already mentions he blends house, disco, indie dance 58  
– that’s good SEO-  
wise for those terms combined with “DJ Brooklyn”. We can strengthen it by adding a bit of copy like  
“Brooklyn house music DJ” in headings or page titles. Right now his tagline is “Brooklyn’s storytelling DJ &  
sonic architect” 51  
– poetic, but not a literal search term someone might use. Perhaps adding a subtitle or  
meta description with “house music, disco, indie dance, DJ in Brooklyn” could help Google associate those  
searches with him. \- Track/Mix Titles: People might search the names of his mixes or projects. For example,  
“Nostalgia Trap mix” or “Disco Ascension Zack Bissell”. Ensuring that his site has dedicated pages or at least  
sections for each major mix with those exact titles (which it does in the “Flagship mixes” section) is great  
59  
60  
. Additionally, having those mixes on YouTube with those titles increases the chance those queries find  
something. The SEO opportunity is to solidify Zack as the top result for any unique project name he creates.  
So far, if one searches “Disco Ascension Zack Bissell,” likely RA or his site or Mixcloud comes up – we want  
his site to be the definitive source. Perhaps a blog post about “The making of Disco Ascension” would  
further cement that while also being interesting content. \- Local SEO for events/gigs: If someone in NYC  
searches “Broken Land DJ Saturday” or “Bushwick DJ residency,” will Zack appear? Possibly via RA or a  
Facebook event. To capture these, Zack could do a couple things: list his residency venues and schedule on  
his site (maybe under a “Tour” or “Events” page that is indexed). His current site’s “Tour” section is a bit  
minimal (the navigation has a Tour page, but it may just prompt to join a mailing list or link to  
Bandsintown). Having an actual text listing of upcoming events on the site (with city, venue, date) will let  
Google pick that up for local queries. Also, Google has started showing event listings in search results (via  
schema markup or via pulling from services like Bandsintown or Songkick). By keeping Bandsintown  
updated, he indirectly feeds Google’s event listings. So from an SEO perspective, maintaining those entries  
means if someone Googles “Zack Bissell tickets” they might see a nice Google Events card with his next  
show. \- Name Confusion/Overlap: The audit should consider if there are any other notable “Zack Bissell”  
14online. It seems there was a search result for a high schooler or another person with the same name on  
Twitter 61  
, and possibly alternate spellings (Zach vs Zack). If “Zach Bissell” is searched, does Zack’s stuff still  
show? Maybe not as well. An opportunity is to include a mention of the alternate spelling on his site (“Zack  
(not Zach) ”) or run a small Google Ad for his name that catches those variants. But that might be overkill;  
generally, the name is distinct enough. \- Music Release SEO: When someone searches a track like “Meridian  
Zack Bissell”, ideally the top results should be an official source (Spotify or his site). Right now, the DSP audit  
noted that direct links for some platforms require search (Spotify, YouTube Music) 43 4  
. To boost this, he  
can create a page on his site specifically for Meridian – e.g., a blog post or press release with the title  
“Meridian – Debut Single by Zack Bissell Out Now” and some SEO copy (mentioning “stream Meridian on  
Spotify, Apple Music” etc.). That way, Google has a relevant page to show beyond just the Spotify link. He  
62  
can also use the Spotify Promo Cards or SmartURL (like he has a Spotify promocard URL in the EPK )  
widely – posting that on socials and press so that more backlinks to it appear. \- Backlinks and Domain  
Authority: One reason Spotify outranks Zack’s own site is because zackbissell.com is new and has few  
backlinks (other sites linking to it). To improve SEO, he should aim to get more references from other sites.  
Some ways: \- Press articles or interviews: Pitch a local music blog or even Medium article about him – any  
write-up with a link helps. His EPK mentions “Featured by Mixcloud and VerseOne” 31  
– if Mixcloud wrote a  
blurb on him or tweeted about his chart success, maybe ensure his site link is there. \- Collaborative content:  
e.g., write a guest blog on a music site about storytelling in DJing, with a link back to his site. \- Ensure that  
on all his profiles that allow a website link (RA, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, YouTube, etc.), he has  
zackbissell.com listed (most do). These are no-follow sometimes but still important for referral traffic. \- Lab  
Obsidian (his label) site or projects should link to him too. If Lab Obsidian has its own domain or page, make  
sure it references Zack as an artist with a link.  
Over time, these will raise his site’s visibility on Google.  
Platform-Specific Search (Algorithmic SEO): \- Spotify search: When a user searches “Zack Bissell” on  
Spotify, he comes up (especially now that he has an official release). More interesting is appearing in  
searches for general terms on Spotify like “Brooklyn house” or being included in playlists. To improve his  
Spotify SEO: \- Once he claims his profile, he should add a compelling Spotify bio that includes searchable  
keywords and maybe mentions Brooklyn/House, etc. (Spotify’s search isn’t as text-based as Google, but it  
can help for the algorithm and certainly for user impression). \- Use Spotify’s tools: create public playlists of  
tracks that inspire him (including his own track) so that his profile shows activity. \- Encourage followers on  
Spotify (e.g., through a Spotify follow link on his pages). A higher follower count can influence the algorithm  
slightly and at least gets listeners notified of new releases. \- When more music comes, make sure to use  
Spotify for Artists to pitch songs to editorial playlists. This is more music marketing than SEO, but  
ultimately being on popular playlists will cause more people to search his name.  
•  
YouTube search: Already discussed – optimize video titles, descriptions, and engage with  
comments. Perhaps also comment as his channel on related videos (e.g., comment something  
thoughtful on a popular disco house mix video – people do click channel names from comments if  
they’re curious).  
•  
SoundCloud search: Ensure tracks have descriptive names and tags. SoundCloud’s search might  
find his mixes if tagged well (e.g., someone searching “disco house mix” could find Disco Ascension if  
that phrase is in the description or tags). He should double-check that. Also, the bio on SoundCloud  
should be updated to focus on his current music style and location (he did update to Brooklyn, which  
is good).  
15•  
Hashtags and keywords on social: While not traditional SEO, using consistent hashtags like  
\#ZackBissell \#HouseMusic \#DiscoHouse on platforms like Instagram/TikTok can help people  
discover him via in-app search. It looks like he does hashtag relevant things on TikTok (e.g.  
\#brooklyn \#housemusic 22  
) – he should continue and maybe standardize a personal hashtag  
(\#StorytellingDJ or something unique, though that might be more for branding than discovery).  
SEO for Narrative and Branding: Because Zack’s differentiator is his narrative approach, he might consider  
publishing content that highlights that in ways search engines pick up: \- A well-written bio page on his site  
(which he has) – maybe expand it with a paragraph explicitly mentioning his background (ex-Broadway  
actor, etc.), because those are unique terms that if someone hears about (“DJ who was a Broadway actor”), a  
search could lead to him if it’s mentioned. Right now his bio on site and EPK does mention Broadway and  
such 63  
. Good. \- Possibly a blog series on his site (or Medium) about the concept behind each mix (e.g.,  
“Inside ‘Nostalgia Trap’: How heartbreak and blocked exes inspired a \#1 mix”). These not only provide great  
material to share on social (driving traffic to site), but also serve SEO queries (someone searching anything  
related to emotional DJ sets or that mix name will find this). \- Collaborations and names: He’s collaborated  
with a few known figures (DJ CherishTheLuv, Jasmine Solano, Just Blaze as per EPK 64  
). A clever SEO move:  
mention those in context on his site (which EPK likely does). If someone googles “Just Blaze Jasmine Solano  
Zack Bissell”, something should come up (maybe a recap of the event they all played). Right now that info is  
in his press kit, but putting out a public blog or post about those collabs could attract those searching those  
bigger names and find him by association.  
Fixing Any SEO Issues: One thing to check is that his website is technically sound – e.g., mobile-friendly,  
fast, and has proper meta tags. Since the site is custom (GitHub code), he should ensure meta descriptions  
55  
are set (the search snippet suggests it is: “Dive into immersive stories through music at ZackBissell.com.” –  
that’s good). Also adding schema markup could be beneficial: for example, JSON-LD schema for  
“MusicalArtist” with his name, genre, hometown, and sameAs links to all his profiles. This can help Google’s  
knowledge graph. If he’s not familiar, a developer or even a tool like Google’s Structured Data Markup  
Helper can assist. It’s a bit technical, but it’s the kind of polish that could set him apart (few indie DJs will  
have that, so it might eventually help trigger a knowledge panel when he’s borderline notable).  
Discoverability in the Industry: Aside from fan searches, SEO can help with industry visibility: \-  
MusicBrainz & Jaxsta: As noted in the DSP audit, adding data to MusicBrainz (an open music encyclopedia)  
and Jaxsta (official credits database) is recommended 65 66  
. By adding an entry on MusicBrainz for Zack  
Bissell (with his releases and basic info), he increases the chance that Google’s knowledge panels or future  
AI search results include a verified profile, since Google often pulls from MusicBrainz/Wikidata for lesser-  
known artists. Jaxsta listing him (especially if his distributor or label gets credits in) will ensure if someone is  
searching in a professional context (“Zack Bissell credits”), they see official info. \- SoundExchange  
registration (mentioned in audit docs) doesn’t impact SEO, but it’s good for royalties. Just to note, he  
67  
should do that for behind-the-scenes completeness .  
Keyword Brainstorm relevant to Zack: \- “storytelling DJ” – a term he uses. SEO volume might be low, but  
he’s basically owning that term in his branding. Continue to push it – maybe he can become synonymous  
with it. \- “immersive DJ set” – similar concept, ensure those words appear around his name on his site or  
YouTube descriptions. \- “disco house mix 2025”, “indie dance DJ set” – target these by using them in titles or  
tags on Mixcloud/YouTube. People do search by year and genre on YouTube especially. \- “Brooklyn DJ events”  
– if he posts event recaps or announcements with location keywords, he might catch local searchers looking  
for something to do (though competition from bigger event sites is high). \- Mix titles and unique concepts like  
16“Groove Singularity” (which he mentioned as inspiration in his mix description 68  
). That term is unique – he  
should capitalize on it by maybe writing a fun piece about it. If that becomes a hook, anyone hearing it will  
attribute it to him via search. \- Lab Obsidian – his label/collective. Searching that currently might only show  
minimal info. He should have at least a page on his site or a separate site with info on Lab Obsidian (even if  
it’s just his own project). If any collaborators or projects come out under it, those should link back to him.  
Essentially, ensure Lab Obsidian and Zack Bissell are interlinked in content so one search leads to the other.  
Competitive/Comparative SEO: Consider peers – e.g., other local DJs or artists with similar styles. See what  
they do. If a DJ with a bit more fame (say someone like Eli Escobar in NYC house scene) has a Wikipedia or  
appears on certain sites, those are avenues for Zack too in time. Even things like podcasts or interviews:  
perhaps Zack could get on a niche music podcast – those often have show notes that appear in search.  
Proactively seeking those out can generate content that boosts SEO (plus it’s promotional in itself).  
Lastly, monitoring: Zack should set up Google Alerts for his name and major mix titles. This way he knows  
when a blog or site mentions him, and he can then capitalize on that (e.g., share it, or ensure they link his  
site). It also helps catch any negative or incorrect info that might pop up so he can address it (though none  
seen now, but as he grows, one negative review or comment could appear – best to stay ahead).  
SEO Bottom Line: Zack’s digital presence will benefit from a more intentional SEO strategy. The key steps: 1\.  
Claim and optimize all artist profiles on DSPs (to control content and cross-link to his website) 3 4  
. 2\.  
Strengthen his website’s content and metadata with targeted keywords (without losing the creative  
voice). Possibly add a news/updates section for fresh content. 3\. Leverage content marketing (stories,  
blog posts, videos) around his unique selling points (narrative, immersive mixes) to capture niche searches  
and build backlinks. 4\. Use structured data and ensure all profiles link back to create a strong  
interconnected web that search algorithms recognize. 5\. Maintain consistency – SEO is not a one-time task  
but an ongoing process of updating content, building links, and adjusting to how people search. For  
instance, if he notices more search hits for “Nostalgia Trap reality slap” after it charted, maybe he makes  
that a heading on his site or a YouTube video title to match demand.  
By implementing these, Zack can significantly improve his discoverability. Instead of only being found by  
those who already know him, he’ll start to attract those who are searching generally for the kind of  
experience he offers – and when they find him, the breadth of his online content (mixes, videos, write-ups)  
will tell a compelling story that can convert searchers into fans.  
Tools & Aggregation – Building a Unified Digital Presence (Post-  
Squarespace)  
Zack previously used Squarespace (implied by “post-Squarespace” in the prompt) for his website or link-in-  
bio. Now, with a custom site live and multiple profiles, it’s crucial to have a single aggregation point for  
fans to find everything and for Zack to easily update his info across platforms. Currently, he’s using bio.site  
as a link aggregator 69  
– which is a good solution (it’s basically LinkTree-like, and his bio.site page is nicely  
populated with links and even embedded content like recent IG posts and Mixcloud listings 70 71  
). Let’s  
evaluate this and other options:  
•  
Bio.site (or Linktree): The advantage is simplicity – one link in Instagram/TikTok bio that leads to all  
important links. Zack’s bio.site is pretty robust: it lists his website, RA, Bandsintown, Mixcloud,  
17•  
•  
SoundCloud, YouTube, etc., and even showcases recent Instagram posts and a “Mixes and Live Sets”  
gallery of Mixcloud links 70 71  
. This is actually a great interim solution after dropping Squarespace.  
It ensures if someone clicks his IG bio, they can get to whichever platform they prefer to follow/  
consume (choices are good for fans). One downside: it’s another thing to update. Zack’s done well  
keeping it current (e.g., it references nostalgia trap hitting \#1 on Mixcloud 72  
, which is very current  
info). If Zack can commit to updating bio.site whenever he has a new link or achievement, it’s  
perfectly fine to continue using. However, bio.site is a third-party platform; some may prefer  
Linktree or similar for analytics or design flexibility. Also, bio.site might not be as known – but since  
it’s working, there’s no urgent need to switch. Alternatives:  
Linktree: Very similar functionally. Zack could use Linktree which is more popular; however, his  
bio.site already does the job and looks unique (and is free). Unless he wants features Linktree has  
(like integration with mailing lists or more themes), there’s no strong reason to switch.  
Solo.to, Carrd, etc.: Many link-in-bio tools exist. Each with slight variations. Again, his current setup  
is fine.  
•  
.bio site vs. building his own directory: The question hints at possibly a “Claude-built directory site”  
or using Claude (an AI) to maintain the guide. Since Zack is tech-savvy enough to have a GitHub for  
his site, one could consider embedding the link directory into his own website. For example, instead of  
relying on bio.site, he could have zackbissell.com/bio or just the homepage serve as the link hub.  
Right now, his site is more elaborate (with mix descriptions, etc.), which might overwhelm someone  
who just wants quick links. One idea: Framer or Notion as alternatives –  
•  
•  
•  
Framer is a website builder that could make a very sleek one-page site combining his branding and  
links. If his current custom site ever becomes too cumbersome to update for quick changes, Framer  
is an option to rebuild a simpler site (it’s designer-friendly and code-optional).  
Notion can be used to create a public page that acts as an electronic press kit or link directory. For  
instance, a Notion page with sections (Bio, Links, Upcoming Shows, Press Photos) could be an all-in-  
one for industry folks. It’s not as pretty for general fans though.  
A Claude-loadable guide or mini app spec – this sounds like using AI to generate an interactive  
FAQ or directory. Potentially, one could feed all his links and bio to an AI chatbot (like a “virtual  
assistant” for Zack’s brand). That’s a cutting-edge idea: fans could ask a chatbot “When’s Zack’s next  
show?” or “Where can I hear his disco mix?” and it responds with the info and links. This might be  
what the prompt suggests for Claude (Anthropic’s AI) – building a mini app that Zack can reuse. It’s a  
bit experimental for an artist, but actually a cool concept given Zack’s tech-forward approach (he did  
brand himself a “sonic architect” after all).  
Practically, though, the simpler approach is to maintain a well-structured Notion or Markdown document  
internally that lists all assets (similar to what we did above), so he or his team can easily update multiple  
platforms. Perhaps the deliverable of this audit itself, in a structured way, serves that purpose.  
•  
•  
•  
Aggregation Tools for Content: Beyond links, Zack might consider tools that aggregate content or  
analytics:  
For social posting, using something like Buffer or Later to schedule posts across Instagram, Twitter,  
Facebook can save time and ensure consistency.  
For monitoring, tools like Hootsuite or even the native Meta Suite can keep track of comments/  
messages in one place.  
18•  
For music, Linkfire or Hypeddit could be used when he releases tracks or mixes – these create one  
smart URL that directs users based on preference (like a landing page for “Listen to Meridian” with  
buttons for Spotify, Apple, SoundCloud, etc.). This is good for marketing campaigns and also tracks  
clicks per platform.  
•  
Backup Options: It’s mentioned “backup options e.g. .bio site, LinkTree alternatives, or mini Claude-  
built directory.” This suggests ensuring that if one platform fails or if he wants more control, he has a  
backup. For instance:  
•  
•  
•  
Maintaining a simple HTML/text version of his EPK or links (maybe on his site) that can be quickly  
updated if a service goes down.  
Exporting his contact/fan list (if he uses mailing list or something) regularly so he always owns that  
data.  
Archiving his content – e.g., downloading all Instagram content somewhere safe, or keeping local  
copies of his mixes and track metadata. This is more digital hygiene but relevant (imagine if  
SoundCloud terminated his account – does he have all the follower data or at least knowledge of  
who to tell? Not really, so having fans on multiple platforms acts as a backup in itself).  
•  
Post-Squarespace migration: We should ensure all traces of the old Squarespace site (if any)  
redirect to the new site or bio. If Zack’s domain was the same (likely yes, he just rebuilt it), then it’s  
fine. But if he had a .squarespace.com address or old links, he might want to set up redirects or  
inform search engines of the change. Since his new site is up and indexed, it seems fine. Just double-  
check:  
•  
•  
Google search console can be used to request removal of any outdated Squarespace pages if they  
linger in results.  
If any partner sites (like a venue page, etc.) still link to an old site, reach out to update the link.  
•  
Brand Consistency and Ease of Use: The ultimate goal of aggregation is to make it dead-simple for  
anyone – fan or industry – to find what they need. With that in mind, Zack should consider having  
two main public entry points:  
•  
•  
One for fans: likely his link-in-bio page or website homepage with clear navigation.  
One for press/industry: perhaps a dedicated page or Notion with downloadable media kit, high-res  
photos, short bio, links to important profiles (already largely covered by his EPK PDF and press  
section on site).  
Right now, his bio.site is serving fans, and the EPK (PDF or in Google Doc) is for press. It might be useful to  
host a press page on his website (so press Googling him don’t have to find a PDF via user files – they likely  
won’t, but maybe he sends it out directly). A “Press” section with the quotes, achievements, and a link to  
73  
download media kit would be perfect. I see in his site menu there is “Press” and “EPK/Bio” pages listed –  
he likely intends to have those. Making sure those pages are live and populated will take the burden off the  
PDF (PDFs aren’t SEO-friendly). Perhaps he’s already on it given the GitHub code shows those pages.  
•  
Claude or AI usage: Zack (or his team) could use AI like Claude to keep content fresh or generate  
quick posts based on an outline. For example, feeding Claude bullet points of an event and getting a  
19nicely written recap to post. But that’s more content creation than aggregation. The mention of a  
“Claude-loadable guide or mini app spec” suggests maybe packaging this audit’s info into a format  
an AI could use to answer questions (like the chatbot idea). We might provide, say, a structured JSON  
of his profiles and details:  
{  
"profiles": {  
"Instagram": "https://instagram.com/zack.bissell",  
"Spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/...",  
...  
},  
"bio": "Zack Bissell is a Brooklyn-based DJ ...",  
"latest\_release": "Meridian (single, Mar 18 2025)",  
"upcoming\_shows": \["Every Sat at Broken Land, Brooklyn", "Jul 30 2025 at  
Elsewhere"\]  
}  
– That could be fed to an AI to keep knowledge updated. It’s a very forward-thinking approach to  
content management. Possibly beyond the scope of this report to include raw JSON, but something  
to mention to him as an idea. Since the user specifically mentioned “Claude-ready,” perhaps they do  
want a structured block in the answer. However, the guidelines say we should keep it readable in  
Markdown, so maybe not full JSON. A compromise is we’ve given a clearly structured link directory  
and inventory in bullet form which is easy to copy. If needed, that can be quickly transformed into  
another format.  
•  
Choosing the Right Tools: If Zack is hands-on (seems like it), he might enjoy using new tools. If not,  
he should pick one aggregator and stick with it to avoid confusion. The audit of his current approach  
(bio.site \+ custom site \+ various socials) suggests complexity, but he’s managing. We should caution:  
simplify where possible. For instance, do we need both bio.site and a full website? Potentially, the  
website could itself act as the link hub on mobile (just design a mobile-friendly landing section).  
However, the website is heavier to load and not as instantly clickable as a link list. One idea: have the  
best of both – embed a “linktree” style section on the site’s homepage. E.g., when someone visits on  
mobile, show big buttons for Spotify, Instagram, etc., above the fold. That way he can in the future  
just promote zackbissell.com everywhere (no middleman service). But until his site is fully tuned for  
that, bio.site is a fine solution.  
Backup and Fallbacks: In case of any platform issue (account hack, etc.), Zack should keep a direct line to  
fans – the classic method is an email newsletter. Does he have one? Possibly not yet. Given his emphasis  
on modern channels, email might feel old-school, but it is the one channel he can own. Even if it’s just  
collecting emails for announcing big releases or shows, it’s a safety net. If tomorrow Instagram banned his  
account erroneously, how would he tell 1.4k followers? If he had 100 of their emails from past Bandcamp  
purchases or a signup form, he could reach them. His site’s contact form likely is just for bookings, not a  
mailing list. So perhaps set up a simple “Subscribe for updates” on his site or link page. This is an often  
overlooked but important part of one’s digital strategy. Not to mention, it’s good for re-engagement (say  
he’s dropping an EP next year, an email blast could help boost day-one listens).  
20Claude AI Mini-app idea (blue-sky): The notion of a mini Claude-built directory or guide is intriguing. For  
example, building a conversational FAQ chatbot on his site (“Ask me about my music”). To implement, one  
could feed an AI with this audit and other context. However, that’s not standard yet on artist sites (and  
might confuse users). It might be more useful internally – e.g., Zack feeding his info to Claude to generate  
press releases or tweets on demand. If he has access to such AI, he can use this data as a knowledge base.  
Since the prompt explicitly mentions it, they might want a structured block output.  
Given readability concerns, I’ll keep our response narrative, but in an appendix or somewhere, we could  
include a structured content block (like a YAML or bullet list, which we did in link directory). We have done  
the link directory and profile inventory in a structured way, which likely satisfies that requirement.  
If needed, one more structured section can be “Data Snapshot for Re-use” where we list key info in a brief  
semi-structured way: \- Name, Genre, Location \- Followers on each platform \- Key links \- etc.  
This can be easily input to an AI or adapted. But this may be redundant now. The directory we provided is  
quite detailed and structured in Markdown.  
Branding-Ready Layout: We have used clear headings, lists, etc., which makes it easy to adapt to a  
polished document. If Zack were to put this audit into Notion or another tool, the headings and lists will  
convert well. The tone we’ve kept is professional but straightforward, and “brutal in clarity” as requested  
(we didn’t shy from pointing out low numbers or needed improvements, albeit respectfully).  
Finally, we should ensure the tone remains constructive. Brutal honesty doesn’t mean negativity for its  
own sake. We pointed out shortcomings but also provided actionable strategies. This way, the audit isn’t  
just critical but actually useful for Zack to move forward.  
To conclude, we might summarize the big-picture: Zack has built a solid foundation online with widespread  
presence; now the task is to connect the dots, fill the gaps, and consistently engage. By doing so, his  
SEO will improve organically (because engaged platforms lead to more shares, more mentions), and his  
social following will grow (leading to more music streams, etc.). This synergy between social activity and  
search visibility is what will elevate him from being just “searchable if you know him” to “discoverable even  
if you don’t.”
