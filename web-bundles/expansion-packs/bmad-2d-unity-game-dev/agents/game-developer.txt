# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Game Development Guidelines (Unity & C#)

## Overview

This document establishes coding standards, architectural patterns, and development practices for 2D game development using Unity and C#. These guidelines ensure consistency, performance, and maintainability across all game development stories.

## C# Standards

### Naming Conventions

**Classes, Structs, Enums, and Interfaces:**
- PascalCase for types: `PlayerController`, `GameData`, `IInteractable`
- Prefix interfaces with 'I': `IDamageable`, `IControllable`
- Descriptive names that indicate purpose: `GameStateManager` not `GSM`

**Methods and Properties:**
- PascalCase for methods and properties: `CalculateScore()`, `CurrentHealth`
- Descriptive verb phrases for methods: `ActivateShield()` not `shield()`

**Fields and Variables:**
- `private` or `protected` fields: camelCase with an underscore prefix: `_playerHealth`, `_movementSpeed`
- `public` fields (use sparingly, prefer properties): PascalCase: `PlayerName`
- `static` fields: PascalCase: `Instance`, `GameVersion`
- `const` fields: PascalCase: `MaxHitPoints`
- `local` variables: camelCase: `damageAmount`, `isJumping`
- Boolean variables with is/has/can prefix: `_isAlive`, `_hasKey`, `_canJump`

**Files and Directories:**
- PascalCase for C# script files, matching the primary class name: `PlayerController.cs`
- PascalCase for Scene files: `MainMenu.unity`, `Level01.unity`

### Style and Formatting

- **Braces**: Use Allman style (braces on a new line).
- **Spacing**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- **`using` directives**: Place all `using` directives at the top of the file, outside the namespace.
- **`this` keyword**: Only use `this` when necessary to distinguish between a field and a local variable/parameter.

## Unity Architecture Patterns

### Scene Lifecycle Management
**Loading and Transitioning Between Scenes:**
```csharp
// SceneLoader.cs - A singleton for managing scene transitions.
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using System.Collections;

public class SceneLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static SceneLoader Instance { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }

    public void LoadGameScene()
    {
        // Example of loading the main game scene, perhaps with a loading screen first.
        StartCoroutine(LoadSceneAsync("Level01"));
    }

    private IEnumerator LoadSceneAsync(string sceneName)
    {
        // Load a loading screen first (optional)
        SceneManager.LoadScene("LoadingScreen");

        // Wait a frame for the loading screen to appear
        yield return null;

        // Begin loading the target scene in the background
        AsyncOperation asyncLoad = SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(sceneName);

        // Don't activate the scene until it's fully loaded
        asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = false;

        // Wait until the asynchronous scene fully loads
        while (!asyncLoad.isDone)
        {
            // Here you could update a progress bar with asyncLoad.progress
            if (asyncLoad.progress >= 0.9f)
            {
                // Scene is loaded, allow activation
                asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = true;
            }
            yield return null;
        }
    }
}
```

### MonoBehaviour Lifecycle
**Understanding Core MonoBehaviour Events:**
```csharp
// Example of a standard MonoBehaviour lifecycle
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // AWAKE: Called when the script instance is being loaded.
    // Use for initialization before the game starts. Good for caching component references.
    private void Awake()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Awake!");
    }

    // ONENABLE: Called when the object becomes enabled and active.
    // Good for subscribing to events.
    private void OnEnable()
    {
        // Example: UIManager.OnGamePaused += HandleGamePaused;
    }

    // START: Called on the frame when a script is enabled just before any of the Update methods are called the first time.
    // Good for logic that depends on other objects being initialized.
    private void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Start!");
    }

    // FIXEDUPDATE: Called every fixed framerate frame.
    // Use for physics calculations (e.g., applying forces to a Rigidbody).
    private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        // Handle Rigidbody movement here.
    }

    // UPDATE: Called every frame.
    // Use for most game logic, like handling input and non-physics movement.
    private void Update()
    {
        // Handle input and non-physics movement here.
    }
    
    // LATEUPDATE: Called every frame, after all Update functions have been called.
    // Good for camera logic that needs to track a target that moves in Update.
    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        // Camera follow logic here.
    }

    // ONDISABLE: Called when the behaviour becomes disabled or inactive.
    // Good for unsubscribing from events to prevent memory leaks.
    private void OnDisable()
    {
        // Example: UIManager.OnGamePaused -= HandleGamePaused;
    }

    // ONDESTROY: Called when the MonoBehaviour will be destroyed.
    // Good for any final cleanup.
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Destroyed!");
    }
}
```

### Game Object Patterns

**Component-Based Architecture:**
```csharp
// Player.cs - The main GameObject class, acts as a container for components.
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerMovement), typeof(PlayerHealth))]
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public PlayerMovement Movement { get; private set; }
    public PlayerHealth Health { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        Movement = GetComponent<PlayerMovement>();
        Health = GetComponent<PlayerHealth>();
    }
}

// PlayerHealth.cs - A component responsible only for health logic.
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private int _maxHealth = 100;
    private int _currentHealth;

    private void Awake()
    {
        _currentHealth = _maxHealth;
    }

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        _currentHealth -= amount;
        if (_currentHealth <= 0)
        {
            Die();
        }
    }

    private void Die()
    {
        // Death logic
        Debug.Log("Player has died.");
        gameObject.SetActive(false);
    }
}
```

### Data-Driven Design with ScriptableObjects

**Define Data Containers:**
```csharp
// EnemyData.cs - A ScriptableObject to hold data for an enemy type.
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "NewEnemyData", menuName = "Game/Enemy Data")]
public class EnemyData : ScriptableObject
{
    public string enemyName;
    public int maxHealth;
    public float moveSpeed;
    public int damage;
    public Sprite sprite;
}

// Enemy.cs - A MonoBehaviour that uses the EnemyData.
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private EnemyData _enemyData;
    private int _currentHealth;

    private void Start()
    {
        _currentHealth = _enemyData.maxHealth;
        GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>().sprite = _enemyData.sprite;
    }
    
    // ... other enemy logic
}
```

### System Management

**Singleton Managers:**
```csharp
// GameManager.cs - A singleton to manage the overall game state.
using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }

    public int Score { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); // Persist across scenes
    }

    public void AddScore(int amount)
    {
        Score += amount;
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Object Pooling

**Required for High-Frequency Objects (e.g., bullets, effects):**
```csharp
// ObjectPool.cs - A generic object pooling system.
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject _prefabToPool;
    [SerializeField] private int _initialPoolSize = 20;

    private Queue<GameObject> _pool = new Queue<GameObject>();

    private void Start()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < _initialPoolSize; i++)
        {
            GameObject obj = Instantiate(_prefabToPool);
            obj.SetActive(false);
            _pool.Enqueue(obj);
        }
    }

    public GameObject GetObjectFromPool()
    {
        if (_pool.Count > 0)
        {
            GameObject obj = _pool.Dequeue();
            obj.SetActive(true);
            return obj;
        }
        // Optionally, expand the pool if it's empty.
        return Instantiate(_prefabToPool);
    }

    public void ReturnObjectToPool(GameObject obj)
    {
        obj.SetActive(false);
        _pool.Enqueue(obj);
    }
}
```

### Frame Rate Optimization

**Update Loop Optimization:**
- Avoid expensive calls like `GetComponent`, `FindObjectOfType`, or `Instantiate` inside `Update()` or `FixedUpdate()`. Cache references in `Awake()` or `Start()`.
- Use Coroutines or simple timers for logic that doesn't need to run every single frame.

**Physics Optimization:**
- Adjust the "Physics 2D Settings" in Project Settings, especially the "Layer Collision Matrix", to prevent unnecessary collision checks.
- Use `Rigidbody2D.Sleep()` for objects that are not moving to save CPU cycles.

## Input Handling

### Cross-Platform Input (New Input System)

**Input Action Asset:** Create an Input Action Asset (`.inputactions`) to define controls.

**PlayerInput Component:**
- Add the `PlayerInput` component to the player GameObject.
- Set its "Actions" to the created Input Action Asset.
- Set "Behavior" to "Invoke Unity Events" to easily hook up methods in the Inspector, or "Send Messages" to use methods like `OnMove`, `OnFire`.

```csharp
// PlayerInputHandler.cs - Example of handling input via messages.
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class PlayerInputHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Vector2 _moveInput;

    // This method is called by the PlayerInput component via "Send Messages".
    // The action must be named "Move" in the Input Action Asset.
    public void OnMove(InputValue value)
    {
        _moveInput = value.Get<Vector2>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Use _moveInput to control the player
        transform.Translate(new Vector3(_moveInput.x, _moveInput.y, 0) * Time.deltaTime * 5f);
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Asset Loading Error Handling:**
- When using Addressables or `Resources.Load`, always check if the loaded asset is null before using it.
```csharp
// Load a sprite and use a fallback if it fails
Sprite playerSprite = Resources.Load<Sprite>("Sprites/Player");
if (playerSprite == null)
{
    Debug.LogError("Player sprite not found! Using default.");
    playerSprite = Resources.Load<Sprite>("Sprites/Default");
}
```

### Runtime Error Recovery

**Assertions and Logging:**
- Use `Debug.Assert(condition, "Message")` to check for critical conditions that must be true.
- Use `Debug.LogError("Message")` for fatal errors and `Debug.LogWarning("Message")` for non-critical issues.
```csharp
// Example of using an assertion to ensure a component exists.
private Rigidbody2D _rb;

void Awake()
{
    _rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    Debug.Assert(_rb != null, "Rigidbody2D component not found on player!");
}
```

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing (Edit Mode)

**Game Logic Testing:**
```csharp
// HealthSystemTests.cs - Example test for a simple health system.
using NUnit.Framework;
using UnityEngine;

public class HealthSystemTests
{
    [Test]
    public void TakeDamage_ReducesHealth()
    {
        // Arrange
        var gameObject = new GameObject();
        var healthSystem = gameObject.AddComponent<PlayerHealth>();
        // Note: This is a simplified example. You might need to mock dependencies.
        
        // Act
        healthSystem.TakeDamage(20);

        // Assert
        // This requires making health accessible for testing, e.g., via a public property or method.
        // Assert.AreEqual(80, healthSystem.CurrentHealth);
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing (Play Mode)

**Scene Testing:**
- Play Mode tests run in a live scene, allowing you to test interactions between multiple components and systems.
- Use `yield return null;` to wait for the next frame.
```csharp
// PlayerJumpTest.cs
using System.Collections;
using NUnit.Framework;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.TestTools;

public class PlayerJumpTest
{
    [UnityTest]
    public IEnumerator PlayerJumps_WhenSpaceIsPressed()
    {
        // Arrange
        var player = new GameObject().AddComponent<PlayerController>();
        var initialY = player.transform.position.y;

        // Act
        // Simulate pressing the jump button (requires setting up the input system for tests)
        // For simplicity, we'll call a public method here.
        // player.Jump(); 

        // Wait for a few physics frames
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);

        // Assert
        Assert.Greater(player.transform.position.y, initialY);
    }
}
```

   - Test cross-platform functionality
   - Validate performance targets

5. **Update Documentation:**
   - Mark story checkboxes complete
   - Document any deviations
   - Update architecture if needed

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] C# code compiles without errors or warnings.
- [ ] All automated tests pass.
- [ ] Code follows naming conventions and architectural patterns.
- [ ] No expensive operations in `Update()` loops.
- [ ] Public fields/methods are documented with comments.
- [ ] New assets are organized into the correct folders.

## Performance Targets

### Frame Rate Requirements

- **PC/Console**: Maintain a stable 60+ FPS.
- **Mobile**: Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range devices, minimum 30 FPS on low-end.
- **Optimization**: Use the Unity Profiler to identify and fix performance drops.

### Memory Management

- **Total Memory**: Keep builds under platform-specific limits (e.g., 200MB for a simple mobile game).
- **Garbage Collection**: Minimize GC spikes by avoiding string concatenation, `new` keyword usage in loops, and by pooling objects.

### Loading Performance

- **Initial Load**: Under 5 seconds for game start.
- **Scene Transitions**: Under 2 seconds between scenes. Use asynchronous scene loading.

These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality game development that meets performance targets and maintains code quality across all implementation stories.
