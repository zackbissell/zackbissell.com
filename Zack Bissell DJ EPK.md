Lab Obsidian – Ethos & Vision

Lab Obsidian – Zack  
ʼ  
s creative label and collective – draws from streetwear,

subculture, editorial design, and post-industrial music scenes. The brand world is

built on "minimalist chaos, editorial hierarchy, anti-polish energy, and absolute

intentionality". In a world of noise, Lab Obsidian forges with sharp edges, full

contrast, and no filler – favoring clarity over clutter, emotion over perfection, and

an unapologetically bold style.
